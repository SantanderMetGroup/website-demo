METACLIP (METAdata for CLImate Products) is a language-independent framework envisaged to tackle the problem of climate product provenance description. The solution proposed is based on semantics exploiting web standard Resource Description Framework (RDF), through the design of domain-specific extensions of standard vocabularies (e.g. PROV-O) describing the different aspects involved in climate product generation. By introducing semantics in the metadata description, METACLIP ensures an effective communication of the information to a wide range of users with different levels of expertise. We present the METACLIP Framework through a bias correction example application within the open source R computing environment and in the context of climate4R, a bundle of climate-oriented R packages, in which a full RDF semantic description of the different elements composing a bias correction product (a climate index future climatology) is produced. A specific on-line application for metadata visualization and interactive exploration is also presented, helping all types of users to trace and understand the provenance of the climate data products. A conceptual framework for the development of a specific bias correction vocabulary is proposed, and a call is done to the community of bias correction experts for possible contributions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Assessing the credibility of different species distribution models to project changes under future climate conditions</title><link>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2016-assessing-the-credibility-of-different/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2016-assessing-the-credibility-of-different/</guid><description>&lt;p>Species Distribution Models (SDMs) are widely applied to estimate future impacts on species distributions and assess key topics in environmental conservation. Future projections vary significantly depending on model algorithms and parameterizations, however, the evaluation of SDMs under future climate change is problematic, as events being predicted have yet not occurred. In front of the lack of an objective basis to perform a selection of various alternatives, we propose a method incorporating niche overlap metrics, for the selection of credible future projections under an ecologically meaningful basis. This method allows the discrimination of useful SDMs from ill-performing ones. In addition, given that the pseudo-absences used to train the model are known to have a significant impact on the results obtained, we analyse this source of uncertainty in future projections for each tested SDM.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We apply the developed method on three phylogenies of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) in Europe, considering three different modelling algorithms and a set of four state of the art regional-global climate model couplings , thus accounting for the main sources of uncertainty of future SDM projections. Finally, we calculate the range of probabilities of future projections obtained from models built for 10 runs of pseuso-absence data generation. Two pseudo-absence generation methods are compared, the commonly used random sampling (RS) and the improved Three-step method (TS).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The niche overlap metric approach enabled an objective quality assessment of each individual SDM. The less complex algorithm (GLM) produced the most credible future projections. Contrarily, MARS (and to a lesser extent also MAXENT) projected the less credible future distributions due to model overfitting. The uncertainty related to pseudo-absence data was also lower for GLM, specially when the TS method was used. Therefore, we conclude that the use of a parsimonious algorithm is the best option in the context of future predictions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Added value of high resolution RCM simulations and comparison with Statistical Downscaling Methods within the EURO-CORDEX framework</title><link>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2016-added-value-of-high-resolution/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2016-added-value-of-high-resolution/</guid><description>&lt;p>High resolution Regional Climate Model (RCM) simulations and Statistical Downscaling Methods (SDMs) are important tools to provide the meteorological variables required in climate impact assessments. The present study analyzes two aspects that should be taken into account before using these methods in specific applications. First, we assess the added value of high resolution simulations from a EURO-CORDEX RCM ensemble. Secondly, RCMs are compared with SDMs, in order to show the merits and limitations of both downscaling techniques. Both aspects are assessed in terms of mean and extreme precipitation indices in Spain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The EURO-CORDEX initiative provides an appropriate framework for this study, since a common grid is used for all RCMs and the high and low resolution grids match each other at the grid cell boundaries. The ability of the high-resolution RCM simulations (0.11°) to represent observed precipitation is assessed at their skillful scale, by aggregating the 0.11° grid to the 0.44° resolution and evaluating the added value with respect to the low resolution (0.44°) runs. Since RCMs are prone to systematic biases, the added value of the high resolution runs is also analyzed after applying bias correction methods to the RCMs. Gridded observational products are available over the same grids as the RCMs, such as the Spain02 v4 family of EURO-CORDEX-compliant gridded datasets over Spain. Therefore, the evaluation of the RCMs and the development of the SDMs can be carried out on exactly the same grids, and SDMs produce a downscaling output comparable to the RCMs. A set of SDMs (namely analog resampling, weather typing and different versions of Generalized Linear Models) are applied using ERA-Interim predictor variables under a cross-validation approach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Results show limited evidence for an added value of the high resolution RCM simulations in terms of seasonal mean biases. There is an indication of added value in the spatial patterns; however, this is not statistically significant after bias correcting both simulations.
The comparison of RCMs and SDMs based on specific precipitation-derived indices may not be fair as long as they are related to parameters that have been optimized in the calibration phase of SDMs. When the comparison is performed in terms of non-optimized parameters (e.g. dry spells), both downscaling techniques present similar skills and limitations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>An intercomparison of a large ensemble of statistical downscaling methods for Europe: Overall results from the VALUE perfect predictor cross-validation experiment</title><link>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2016-an-intercomparison-of-a-large/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2016-an-intercomparison-of-a-large/</guid><description>&lt;p>VALUE is an open European network to validate and compare downscaling methods for climate change research (&lt;a href="http://www.value-cost.eu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.value-cost.eu&lt;/a>). A key deliverable of VALUE is the development of a systematic validation framework to enable the assessment and comparison of both dynamical and statistical downscaling methods. This framework is based on a user-focused validation tree, guiding the selection of relevant validation indices and performance measures for different aspects of the validation (marginal, temporal, spatial, multi-variable). Moreover, several experiments have been designed to isolate specific points in the downscaling procedure where problems may occur (assessment of intrinsic performance, effect of errors inherited from the global models, effect of non-stationarity, etc.). The list of downscaling experiments includes 1) cross-validation with perfect predictors, 2) GCM predictors –aligned with EURO-CORDEX experiment– and 3) pseudo reality predictors (see Maraun et al. 2015, Earth’s Future, 3, doi:10.1002/2014EF000259, for more details). The results of these experiments are gathered, validated and publicly distributed through the VALUE validation portal, allowing for a comprehensive community-open downscaling intercomparison study.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this contribution we describe the overall results from Experiment 1), consisting of a European wide 5- fold cross-validation (with consecutive 6-year periods from 1979 to 2008) using predictors from ERA-Interim to downscale precipitation and temperatures (minimum and maximum) over a set of 86 ECA&amp;amp;D stations representative of the main geographical and climatic regions in Europe. As a result of the open call for contribution to this experiment (closed in Dec. 2015), over 40 methods representative of the main approaches (MOS and Perfect Prognosis, PP) and techniques (linear scaling, quantile mapping, analogs, weather typing, linear and generalized regression, weather generators, etc.) were submitted, including information both data (downscaled values) and metadata (characterizing different aspects of the downscaling methods). This constitutes the largest and most comprehensive to date intercomparison of statistical downscaling methods. Here, we present an overall validation, analyzing marginal and temporal aspects to assess the intrinsic performance and added value of statistical downscaling methods at both annual and seasonal levels. This validation takes into account the different properties/limitations of different approaches and techniques (as reported in the provided metadata) in order to perform a fair comparison. It is pointed out that this experiment alone is not sufficient to evaluate the limitations of (MOS) bias correction techniques. Moreover, it also does not fully validate PP since we don’t learn whether we have the right predictors and whether the PP assumption is valid. These problems will be analyzed in the subsequent community-open VALUE experiments 2) and 3), which will be open for participation along the present year.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Assessing the role of regional climate models as intermediaries between global models and bias correction methods</title><link>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2015-assessing-the-role-of-regional/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2015-assessing-the-role-of-regional/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently, the amount of publicly available future climate simulations has greatly increased, allowing for more robust climate change uncertainty assessments. However, the number of available experiments is strongly reduced when considering only computationally costly regional climate model (RCM) runs. These simulations are used as input for many impact studies, but usually after a statistical post-processing which takes into account the observations at station level (or very high resolution grids) and is commonly known as bias correction. These methods have been primarily developed for removing model biases, although they are also implicitly used to bridge the scale mismatch between model grids and local observations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given that bias correction can be directly applied to Global Circulation Models (GCMs), we assess the role of RCMs as intermediaries between GCMs and bias correction methods. We apply different bias correction methods (from the simple scaling to different versions of the quantile-quantile mapping) directly to daily precipitation from a set of coarse resolution CMIP5 GCMs and compare them with bias-corrected EURO-CORDEX RCMs (namely COSMO-CLM and RCA at 12km horizontal resolution) for historical and future periods. We use a subset of European stations from the ECA&amp;amp;D dataset as observational reference for the bias correction. Additionally, a refined analysis in the Ebro catchment illustrates the effect of bias correction on spatial climate variability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The evaluation experiment of the historical simulations in a cross-validation framework shows that bias corrected RCMs and GCMs typically present similar biases, but an added value of RCMs is found for the spatial analysis. Second, the basic features and the overall magnitude of the climate change signal are preserved after applying bias correction, although in some cases the uncertainty in the climate change signal is amplified by bias correction.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Activities of the Santander MetGroup in relation to M5S, GCM, RCM, ESD and OBS</title><link>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2014-activities-of-the-santander-metgroup/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2014-activities-of-the-santander-metgroup/</guid><description>&lt;p>Summary of the Santander MetGroup activity, as hosting group of the workshop.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Assessing the drift of seasonal forecasts</title><link>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2014-assessing-the-drift-of-seasonal/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2014-assessing-the-drift-of-seasonal/</guid><description>&lt;p>The systematic drift (bias dependence on the forecast lead-time) present in state-of-the-art coupled general circulation models is an inherent feature of global seasonal forecasts. Usually, anomalies (relative to the model climatology) obtained from an ensemble of hindcasts are used to correct this drift. However, this procedure has not been systematically explored across different forecasting systems so far. Moreover, costly approaches for seasonal impacts forecasting, such as dynamical downscaling, would benefit from drift removal strategies involving smaller ensemble sizes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The full thirty-year (1981-2010) hindcast of the System 4 ECWMF (in particular the 15-members seasonal experiment) was considered to address these issues over two regions of interest for the EU project EUPORIAS, Europe and East Africa. The mean climatology for each calendar month was computed at seven different lead-times (each member was initialized the first of each month and was run for seven months). For instance,the climatology of January was computed considering the forecasts initialized the first of January (lead-month 0), December (lead-month 1) and so on until July (lead-month 6). Results show important drifts for some cases. Moreover, the differences between members are statistically not significant in general, what suggests that considering a single member may be enough to robustly remove the drift.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the near future, additional forecasting systems involved in EUPORIAS will be compared with System 4 in order to unveil possible commonalities in the drift climatology.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Assessing the predictability of fire occurrence and area burned across phytoclimatic regions in Spain</title><link>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2013-assessing-the-predictability-of-fire/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2013-assessing-the-predictability-of-fire/</guid><description>&lt;p>We address the predictability of daily fire occurrence using the components of the Canadian Fire Weather Index System (FWI) and related variables calculated from the ERA-Interim reanalysis.
We develop models in peninsular Spain for the period 1990-2008 for daily fire occurrence (GLMs) and monthly burned area (MARS), and for different phytoclimatic regions.
We assess occurrence model performance using ROC skill area (RSA) and testing their ability to reproduce inter-annual fire-frequency variability, considering different burned area thresholds.
The sensitivity of the models to the level of spatial aggregation of the data is also evaluated. Additionally, we investigate the gain in model performance with the inclusion of socio-economic and land use/land cover (LULC) covariates in model formulation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Comparison of Statistical, Dynamical and Combined MOS Downscaling Approaches in the Framework of the PNACC-2012 Spanish Program</title><link>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2013-a-comparison-of-statistical-dynamical/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2013-a-comparison-of-statistical-dynamical/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this work we present a comparison of dynamical and statistical (both perfect prognosis and Model Output Statistics, MOS) downscaling techniques focusing on maximum temperature and precipitation in the Iberian peninsula —a complex climate region with Atlantic, continental, and Mediterranean influences.— To this aim, the same forcing conditions (from ERA40 re- analysis data) are considered for all methods and a k- fold cross validation is conducted focusing on different validation scores. The methods are assessed not only in terms of accuracy and distributional similarity, but also considering their robustness/stationarity in changing climate conditions; to this aim, anomalous historical periods (warm/cold for maximum temperature and wet/dry for precipitation) are used as surrogates of possible future climate alterations, and differences with normal periods are tested using a standard Student t-test. As a result, the strengths and limitations of these techniques in terms of their robust applicability in climate change studies are reported.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As most important results, the statistical/dynamical downscaling approaches show the best/worst performance in terms of accuracy and distributional similarity; however, MOS techniques are able to correct the deficiencies of the dynamical models according to the referece observations. However, the known limitations of the analogue method to reach unobserved values affect the robustness of statistical downscaling methods, mainly in the case of the maximum temperature, which are less robust than the dynamical ones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, we compare the 21st century regional projections for Spain obtained with the above methods in the framework of the Spanish Plan for Regional Climate Change Scenarios (PNACC-2012) showing that, when discarding nonrobust methods, both dynamical and statistical projections are in good agreement.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ability of statistical and dynamical downscaling approaches to reproduce mean and heavy precipitation at different spatial scales over Europe</title><link>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2013-ability-of-statistical-and-dynamical/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2013-ability-of-statistical-and-dynamical/</guid><description>&lt;p>The present study compares statistical downscaling methods (SDMs) and dynamical downscaling with nested regional climate models (RCMs) at different target spatial scales over two European regions. All downscaling products were developed in the framework of Euro-CORDEX and use the ERA-Interim reanalysis as boundary conditions (in RCMs) and as large-scale predictor data (in SDMs). Downscaled precipitation is evaluated at two horizontal resolutions (0.11º and 0.44º) using simulations from the Euro-CORDEX RCM ensemble and SDS methods trained against gridded observational data. The objectives of the work are: (1) to compare both downscaling methodologies, to identify their respective strengths and weaknesses at (2) different spatial scales and considering (3) mean and heavy daily precipitation, and (4) to assess the impact of bias correction methods.
We focus on two target areas in Europe: Continental Spain and the European Alps, where high-resolution and high-quality gridded observational data sets are available. Moreover, these areas represent a variety of climate conditions. Over Spain, the Spain011/044 data sets are considered, which exactly match the Euro-CORDEX grid over Spain. The Alpine data set has been derived from the EURO4M gridded precipitation product provided by MeteoSwiss at 5km resolution. Observations were spatially averaged to match the Euro-CORDEX grid cells. In order to make the SDM results comparable, they were calibrated using the gridded observations as predictand and model performance was evaluated in a cross-validation framework. Bias correction methods and an additional SD step are applied to the RCM data to also incorporate observational information. The ability of the high-resolution RCM simulations (0.11°) to represent observed precipitation is furthermore assessed at their skillful scale, by aggregating the 0.11° grid to the 0.44° resolution and evaluating the added value with respect to the low resolution (0.44°) runs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A new high resolution climate dataset in the Basque Country: Application for ecological niche modelling and future climate impact estimates</title><link>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2013-a-new-high-resolution-climate/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2013-a-new-high-resolution-climate/</guid><description>&lt;p>Global bioclimatic datasets are widely used in ecological research to estimate the potential distribution of species. Although these datasets offer high resolution information, they have not been tested rigorously in smaller regions, hence, it might not be appropriate to use them for the development of species distribution models (SDMs) due to their poor representation of local climate features. Moreover, this problem may be aggravated when predicting potential distributions in the future as a consequence of the uncertainty derived from the future altered climate scenarios. Faced with this problem a high resolution grid for the Basque Country has been developed as an alternative to existing public products: The Regional Baseline Climate of the Basque Country (RCBC). In this study we have modelled tree species under different climate datasets and SDM techniques in the Basque Country (Northern Iberian Peninsula), in order to compare the RCBC with the WorldClim bioclimatic dataset (WC) in a region of complex orography.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A multi-physics ensemble over the CORDEX-Africa domain</title><link>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2012-a-multi-physics-ensemble-over-the/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2012-a-multi-physics-ensemble-over-the/</guid><description>&lt;p>WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) model is a state of the art regional model whose use has spread worldwide. This kind of models solves the atmospheric circulation equations for a resolution higher than the Global Circulation Models (GCMs). Due to the coarse resolution of the latter, Regional Climate Models (RCMs) as WRF try to better represent climate for specific regions. WRF is a very flexible model and several different configurations can be selected changing the different parameterizations. For this reason, each configuration can be considered as a different model and the biases of the different configurations are as large as those corresponding to different RCMs (Vautard et al. 2012). Nowadays many research groups have run their own configurations, but analysing the sensitivity of the model to each configuration for each region is a relevant issue, since results can change significantly.
We focus our analysis on the African domain, which is the CORDEX priority. Our study is motivated by the need to find the best set of parameterizations for Africa concerning temperature and precipitation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A new source of seasonal predictability for the winter climate in Spain</title><link>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2012-a-new-source-of-seasonal/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Sep 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2012-a-new-source-of-seasonal/</guid><description>&lt;p>In a previously published study (Cohen &amp;amp; Jones 2011), an index describing the increase of Eurasian snow cover during October (Snow Advance Index, SAI) has shown to be associated with the Arctic Oscillation (AO) in the following winter (DJF). Based on this finding, we demonstrate that a modified version of the October SAI is highly correlated with the DJF-mean North Atlantic Oscillation, as well as with the concurrent values for precipitation, insolation and wind speed over Spain. Exploiting this formerly unknown lagged teleconnection, a statistical forecasting scheme is applied to predict the above mentioned variables one month ahead. The hindcast skill obtained from a one-year out cross-validation considerably outperforms the results of any competing dynamical and empirical forecasting approach available to date.&lt;/p>

To this aim, we introduce a new score to estimate the robustness of these methods to warming and drying climate conditions, as given by anomalously warm/dry years in the observational record. This score is applied to assess the relative performance of twelve different methods (from the analog, weather typing, weather generator, regression and GLM families) for downscaling temperatures and precipitation in Spain. Since the temperatures in the observed warm years are significantly underestimated by the analog and weather generator approaches, special care has to be taken when applying them to GCM scenario runs. This is demonstrated by relating the robustness-score to the mean relative warming obtained from applying the SD-methods to the A1B scenario run (2071-2100) from the ECHAM5 Global Climate Model.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Actual and future trends of extreme values of temperature for the NW Iberian Peninsula</title><link>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2009-actual-and-future-trends-of/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Sep 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2009-actual-and-future-trends-of/</guid><description>&lt;p>It is now very well established that yearly averaged temperatures are increasing due to anthropogenic climate change. In the area of Galicia (NW Spain) this trend has also been determined. The main objective of this work is to assess actual and future trends of different extreme indices of temperature, which are of crucial importance for many impact studies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As direct GCM-output significantly underestimates the variance of daily surface temperature variables in NW Spain, these are obtained by applying a statistical downscaling technique (analog method), using 850hPa temperature and mean sea level pressure as combined predictors. The predictor fields have been extracted from a multi-model multi initial conditions ensemble of 14 runs of three GCMs participating in the IPCC AR4.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For 1960-2006 results show a significant increase of the number of days with maximum temperatures above the 90th percentile. Furthermore, a significant decrease of the days with maximum temperatures below the 10th percentile has been found. The tendencies of minimum temperatures are reverse: less nights with minimum temperatures below the 10th percentile and more with minimum temperatures above 90th percentile. Those tendencies can be observed all over the year, but are more pronounced in summer. Results for relationship between the above mentioned extreme values and different North Atlantic teleconnection patterns show that local tendencies are associated with trends of EA (Eastern Atlantic) and SCA (Scandinavian) patterns. The NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation) only in winter is related to the number of cold days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ensemble climate projections generated with the analog method indicate that the observed (linear) trends of maximum and minimum temperatures in NW Spain are expected to continue in the next decades. Furthermore the uncertainty interval of these projections (2021-2050) is dominated by model uncertainties rather than by forcing uncertainties.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We conclude that more frequent hot days as well as an increasing probability of summertime heat waves are to be expected in the next decades. Cold days tend to diminish, decreasing the probability of wintertime cold waves and leaving a greater part of the area under study without frost throughout the year.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Analysis of Extreme Temperatures in Iberia: Observations and RCM Simulations from the ENSEMBLES Project</title><link>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2009-analysis-of-extreme-temperatures-in/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Apr 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2009-analysis-of-extreme-temperatures-in/</guid><description>&lt;p>The study of climate extremes is an active research topic with huge socioeconomic impacts (see Easterling et al 2000 and references therein). Most of the results published in the literature are based on univariate GEV or POT models, applied to either observations (Brown et al. 2008) or global (Goubana and Li, 2007) and regional (Frei et al. 2006) simulations. These studies have reported different trends in the temperature and precipitation extremes for the 20th century and future climate scenarios in different regions of interest. In the present work, we use state-of-the-art observed and simulated data over Europe, developed in the ENSEMBLES project (&lt;a href="https://www.ensembles-eu.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.ensembles-eu.org&lt;/a>), to analyze and compare the observed and simulated temperature extremes in the Iberian peninsula. In particular, we consider the ENSEMBLES gridded observations and the ensemble of RCM simulations with a common resolution of 25km. In the future, we plan to study the effect of spatial dependence in the obtained results using appropriate multivariate techniques.&lt;/p>

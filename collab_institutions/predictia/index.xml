METACLIP (METAdata for CLImate Products) is a language-independent framework envisaged to tackle the problem of climate product provenance description. The solution proposed is based on semantics exploiting web standard Resource Description Framework (RDF), through the design of domain-specific extensions of standard vocabularies (e.g. PROV-O) describing the different aspects involved in climate product generation. By introducing semantics in the metadata description, METACLIP ensures an effective communication of the information to a wide range of users with different levels of expertise. We present the METACLIP Framework through a bias correction example application within the open source R computing environment and in the context of climate4R, a bundle of climate-oriented R packages, in which a full RDF semantic description of the different elements composing a bias correction product (a climate index future climatology) is produced. A specific on-line application for metadata visualization and interactive exploration is also presented, helping all types of users to trace and understand the provenance of the climate data products. A conceptual framework for the development of a specific bias correction vocabulary is proposed, and a call is done to the community of bias correction experts for possible contributions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Advantages and limitations of different statistical downscaling approaches for seasonal forecasting</title><link>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2016-advantages-and-limitations-of-different/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2016-advantages-and-limitations-of-different/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Assessing the role of regional climate models as intermediaries between global models and bias correction methods</title><link>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2015-assessing-the-role-of-regional/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2015-assessing-the-role-of-regional/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently, the amount of publicly available future climate simulations has greatly increased, allowing for more robust climate change uncertainty assessments. However, the number of available experiments is strongly reduced when considering only computationally costly regional climate model (RCM) runs. These simulations are used as input for many impact studies, but usually after a statistical post-processing which takes into account the observations at station level (or very high resolution grids) and is commonly known as bias correction. These methods have been primarily developed for removing model biases, although they are also implicitly used to bridge the scale mismatch between model grids and local observations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given that bias correction can be directly applied to Global Circulation Models (GCMs), we assess the role of RCMs as intermediaries between GCMs and bias correction methods. We apply different bias correction methods (from the simple scaling to different versions of the quantile-quantile mapping) directly to daily precipitation from a set of coarse resolution CMIP5 GCMs and compare them with bias-corrected EURO-CORDEX RCMs (namely COSMO-CLM and RCA at 12km horizontal resolution) for historical and future periods. We use a subset of European stations from the ECA&amp;amp;D dataset as observational reference for the bias correction. Additionally, a refined analysis in the Ebro catchment illustrates the effect of bias correction on spatial climate variability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The evaluation experiment of the historical simulations in a cross-validation framework shows that bias corrected RCMs and GCMs typically present similar biases, but an added value of RCMs is found for the spatial analysis. Second, the basic features and the overall magnitude of the climate change signal are preserved after applying bias correction, although in some cases the uncertainty in the climate change signal is amplified by bias correction.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Comparison of Statistical, Dynamical and Combined MOS Downscaling Approaches in the Framework of the PNACC-2012 Spanish Program</title><link>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2013-a-comparison-of-statistical-dynamical/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2013-a-comparison-of-statistical-dynamical/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this work we present a comparison of dynamical and statistical (both perfect prognosis and Model Output Statistics, MOS) downscaling techniques focusing on maximum temperature and precipitation in the Iberian peninsula —a complex climate region with Atlantic, continental, and Mediterranean influences.— To this aim, the same forcing conditions (from ERA40 re- analysis data) are considered for all methods and a k- fold cross validation is conducted focusing on different validation scores. The methods are assessed not only in terms of accuracy and distributional similarity, but also considering their robustness/stationarity in changing climate conditions; to this aim, anomalous historical periods (warm/cold for maximum temperature and wet/dry for precipitation) are used as surrogates of possible future climate alterations, and differences with normal periods are tested using a standard Student t-test. As a result, the strengths and limitations of these techniques in terms of their robust applicability in climate change studies are reported.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As most important results, the statistical/dynamical downscaling approaches show the best/worst performance in terms of accuracy and distributional similarity; however, MOS techniques are able to correct the deficiencies of the dynamical models according to the referece observations. However, the known limitations of the analogue method to reach unobserved values affect the robustness of statistical downscaling methods, mainly in the case of the maximum temperature, which are less robust than the dynamical ones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, we compare the 21st century regional projections for Spain obtained with the above methods in the framework of the Spanish Plan for Regional Climate Change Scenarios (PNACC-2012) showing that, when discarding nonrobust methods, both dynamical and statistical projections are in good agreement.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ability of statistical and dynamical downscaling approaches to reproduce mean and heavy precipitation at different spatial scales over Europe</title><link>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2013-ability-of-statistical-and-dynamical/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2013-ability-of-statistical-and-dynamical/</guid><description>&lt;p>The present study compares statistical downscaling methods (SDMs) and dynamical downscaling with nested regional climate models (RCMs) at different target spatial scales over two European regions. All downscaling products were developed in the framework of Euro-CORDEX and use the ERA-Interim reanalysis as boundary conditions (in RCMs) and as large-scale predictor data (in SDMs). Downscaled precipitation is evaluated at two horizontal resolutions (0.11º and 0.44º) using simulations from the Euro-CORDEX RCM ensemble and SDS methods trained against gridded observational data. The objectives of the work are: (1) to compare both downscaling methodologies, to identify their respective strengths and weaknesses at (2) different spatial scales and considering (3) mean and heavy daily precipitation, and (4) to assess the impact of bias correction methods.
We focus on two target areas in Europe: Continental Spain and the European Alps, where high-resolution and high-quality gridded observational data sets are available. Moreover, these areas represent a variety of climate conditions. Over Spain, the Spain011/044 data sets are considered, which exactly match the Euro-CORDEX grid over Spain. The Alpine data set has been derived from the EURO4M gridded precipitation product provided by MeteoSwiss at 5km resolution. Observations were spatially averaged to match the Euro-CORDEX grid cells. In order to make the SDM results comparable, they were calibrated using the gridded observations as predictand and model performance was evaluated in a cross-validation framework. Bias correction methods and an additional SD step are applied to the RCM data to also incorporate observational information. The ability of the high-resolution RCM simulations (0.11°) to represent observed precipitation is furthermore assessed at their skillful scale, by aggregating the 0.11° grid to the 0.44° resolution and evaluating the added value with respect to the low resolution (0.44°) runs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A new source of seasonal predictability for the winter climate in Spain</title><link>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2012-a-new-source-of-seasonal/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Sep 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2012-a-new-source-of-seasonal/</guid><description>&lt;p>In a previously published study (Cohen &amp;amp; Jones 2011), an index describing the increase of Eurasian snow cover during October (Snow Advance Index, SAI) has shown to be associated with the Arctic Oscillation (AO) in the following winter (DJF). Based on this finding, we demonstrate that a modified version of the October SAI is highly correlated with the DJF-mean North Atlantic Oscillation, as well as with the concurrent values for precipitation, insolation and wind speed over Spain. Exploiting this formerly unknown lagged teleconnection, a statistical forecasting scheme is applied to predict the above mentioned variables one month ahead. The hindcast skill obtained from a one-year out cross-validation considerably outperforms the results of any competing dynamical and empirical forecasting approach available to date.&lt;/p>

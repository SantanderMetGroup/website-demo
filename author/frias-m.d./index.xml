and socio-economic issue. The last few decades though, the number of forest fires has significantly increased, as&lt;br />
well as their severity and impact on the environment. Local fire danger projections are often required when dealing&lt;br />
with wild fire research. In the present study the application of statistical downscaling and spatial interpolation&lt;br />
methods was performed to the Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI), in order to assess forest fire risk in Greece.&lt;br />
The FWI is used worldwide (including the Mediterranean basin) to estimate the fire danger in a generalized fuel&lt;br />
type, based solely on weather observations. The meteorological inputs to the FWI System are noon values of&lt;br />
dry-bulb temperature, air relative humidity, 10m wind speed and precipitation during the previous 24 hours.&lt;br />
The statistical downscaling methods are based on a statistical model that takes into account empirical relationships&lt;br />
between large scale variables (used as predictors) and local scale variables. In the framework&lt;br />
of the current study the statistical downscaling portal developed by the Santander Meteorology Group&lt;br />
(&lt;a href="https://www.meteo.unican.es/downscaling" title="https://www.meteo.unican.es/downscaling">https://www.meteo.unican.es/downscaling&lt;/a>) in the framework of the EU project CLIMRUN (&lt;a href="http://www.climrun.eu" title="www.climrun.eu">www.climrun.eu&lt;/a>)&lt;br />
was used to downscale non standard parameters related to forest fire risk.&lt;br />
In this study, two different approaches were adopted. Firstly, the analogue downscaling technique was directly&lt;br />
performed to the FWI index values and secondly the same downscaling technique was performed indirectly through&lt;br />
the meteorological inputs of the index. In both cases, the statistical downscaling portal was used considering the&lt;br />
ERA-Interim reanalysis as predictands due to the lack of observations at noon.&lt;br />
Additionally, a three-dimensional (3D) interpolation method of position and elevation, based on Thin Plate Splines&lt;br />
(TPS) was used, to interpolate the ERA-Interim data used to calculate the index. Results from this method were&lt;br />
compared with the statistical downscaling results obtained from the portal.&lt;br />
Finally, FWI was computed using weather observations obtained from the Hellenic National Meteorological Service,&lt;br />
mainly in the south continental part of Greece and a comparison with the previous results was performed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Assessment of extreme temperature percentiles by means of Regional Climate Models</title><link>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2012-assessment-of-extreme-temperature-percentiles/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:33:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2012-assessment-of-extreme-temperature-percentiles/</guid><description>&lt;p>The study of extreme events has become of great interest in the recent years due to their direct impact on society. Extremes can be evaluated both by using extreme value theory or deriving extreme indicators, which are usually based on statistics on the tail of the probability distribution. Some of the most commonly used indicators are based on percentiles. In this study we calculate the most extreme percentiles in maximum (90p, 95p and 99p) and minimum (1p, 5p and 10p) temperature derived from the application of dynamical downscaling methods in the Iberian Peninsula. We analyze the regional climate models (RCMs) of the ENSEMBLES (EU-funded) and ESCENA (strategic action of Plan Nacional de I+D+i 2008-2011 funded by the Spanish government) projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The dynamical downscaling methods are first tested in present climate with quasi-perfect (reanalysis) boundary conditions in order to know to what extent these approaches properly reproduce the observed percentiles. Then, we analyze the effect of nesting the RCMs to different Global Circulation Models (GCMs) on the 20C3M scenario. The study focuses on the end of the 20th century (1961–2000), used as a reference period, and assesses the changes projected for the period 2031–2050 considering the A1B emission scenario.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The comparison among the different models is obtained in terms of both the annual and seasonal biases. Analyzing the bias patterns, we are able to know whether the inter-RCM variability leads to larger biases than those due to the driving GCM. Moreover, due to the sensitivity of the results to the observational dataset used for the comparison, we consider the new, public, gridded dataset developed for continental Spain and Balearic Islands with 0.2º resolution (Spain02; Herrera et al. 2012).&lt;/p>

Most of the results published in the literature are based on univariate GEV or POT models, applied to either observations (Brown et al. 2008) or global (Goubana and Li, 2007) and regional (Frei et al. 2006) simulations. These studies have reported different trends in the temperature and precipitation extremes for the 20th century and future climate scenarios in different regions of interest. In the present work, we use state-of-the-art observed and simulated data over Europe, developed in the ENSEMBLES project (&lt;a href="http://www.ensembles-eu.org" title="www.ensembles-eu.org">www.ensembles-eu.org&lt;/a>), to analyze and compare the observed and simulated temperature extremes in the Iberian peninsula. In particular, we consider the ENSEMBLES gridded observations and the ensemble of RCM simulations with a common resolution of 25km. In the future, we plan to study the effect of spatial dependence in the obtained results using appropriate multivariate techniques.&lt;/p>

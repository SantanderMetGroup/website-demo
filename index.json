This unfunded initiative provides a common framework for downscaling activities around the world. The ongoing second phase, focused on regional challenges through Flagship Pilot Studies (FPS) and the production of homogeneous information across the world (CORDEX-CORE), provides key regional climate information and science to the 6th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\nThe research team of this proposal has been involved in CORDEX activities since its inception. With the support of the Spanish National R\u0026amp;D Programme, we have contributed to CORDEX using dynamical downscaling through Regional Climate Models (RCMs; CORWES 2011-2014 and INSIGNIA 2017-2020) and statistical downscaling, including bias adjustment methods (MULTI-SDM 2016-2019). In this series of projects, we have developed downscaling tools, applied them in the different CORDEX phases, and actively participated in the coordinated science derived from them. This past activity has positioned the team as the only Spanish research group contributing future regional climate projections (European and South American domains at 0.44º) to the CORDEX ensemble, and the first to deploy in Spain a data node of the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF), in charge of distributing CORDEX data, among others.\nCORDEX is currently facing the downscaling of CMIP6 global climate models (GCMs), which represent the latest generation of Coupled Earth System Models. The CORDyS project aims to contribute to this next generation of CORDEX regional climate projections using both dynamical and statistical downscaling methods, including statistical emulators of the dynamical models. Our objective is to contribute to (1) the process-based evaluation of the driving GCMs, (2) the downscaling of future climate projections for the current standard continental-scale CORDEX EUR-11 domain, (3) the further downscaling of future projections at very high resolution using a convection-permitting RCM and statistical emulators, (4) the distillation of actionable regional climate information for impacts assessment from these new-generation sources, and (5) the dissemination and publication of results and data products in the CORDEX community and ESGF infrastructure.\nThese activities build on well-established previous efforts and contribute to the current forefront of CORDEX, positioning the group internationally and contributing to an initiative which returns climate information for, essentially, all projects and research groups working on regional climate research and other users assessing vulnerability, impacts and adaptation measures for future climate change at regional scales. At a national level, the results of this project will inform and contribute to Escenarios-PNACC (Plan Nacional de Adaptación al Cambio Climático), providing climate projections which build on the CORDEX experience and use the reference observational datasets.\n","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"c69ab6ebebe168e93f5bf14593b23929","permalink":"https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/project/cordys/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/website-demo/project/cordys/","section":"project","summary":"CORDyS contributes to the next generation of CORDEX regional climate projections using both dynamical and statistical downscaling methods, including statistical emulators of the dynamical models.

We present the METACLIP Framework through a bias correction example application within the open source R computing environment and in the context of climate4R, a bundle of climate-oriented R packages, in which a full RDF semantic description of the different elements composing a bias correction product (a climate index future climatology) is produced. A specific on-line application for metadata visualization and interactive exploration is also presented, helping all types of users to trace and understand the provenance of the climate data products.

Future projections vary significantly depending on model algorithms and parameterizations, however, the evaluation of SDMs under future climate change is problematic, as events being predicted have yet not occurred. In front of the lack of an objective basis to perform a selection of various alternatives, we propose a method incorporating niche overlap metrics, for the selection of credible future projections under an ecologically meaningful basis. This method allows the discrimination of useful SDMs from ill-performing ones. In addition, given that the pseudo-absences used to train the model are known to have a significant impact on the results obtained, we analyse this source of uncertainty in future projections for each tested SDM.\nWe apply the developed method on three phylogenies of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) in Europe, considering three different modelling algorithms and a set of four state of the art regional-global climate model couplings , thus accounting for the main sources of uncertainty of future SDM projections. Finally, we calculate the range of probabilities of future projections obtained from models built for 10 runs of pseuso-absence data generation. Two pseudo-absence generation methods are compared, the commonly used random sampling (RS) and the improved Three-step method (TS).\nThe niche overlap metric approach enabled an objective quality assessment of each individual SDM. The less complex algorithm (GLM) produced the most credible future projections. Contrarily, MARS (and to a lesser extent also MAXENT) projected the less credible future distributions due to model overfitting. The uncertainty related to pseudo-absence data was also lower for GLM, specially when the TS method was used. Therefore, we conclude that the use of a parsimonious algorithm is the best option in the context of future predictions.\n","date":1472428800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1472428800,"objectID":"b710ee7d1ff9c0054dff518fa42983f9","permalink":"https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2016-assessing-the-credibility-of-different/","publishdate":"2022-03-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/website-demo/event/2016-assessing-the-credibility-of-different/","section":"event","summary":"Species Distribution Models (SDMs) are widely applied to estimate future impacts on species distributions and assess key topics in environmental conservation.

The present study analyzes two aspects that should be taken into account before using these methods in specific applications. First, we assess the added value of high resolution simulations from a EURO-CORDEX RCM ensemble. Secondly, RCMs are compared with SDMs, in order to show the merits and limitations of both downscaling techniques. Both aspects are assessed in terms of mean and extreme precipitation indices in Spain.\nThe EURO-CORDEX initiative provides an appropriate framework for this study, since a common grid is used for all RCMs and the high and low resolution grids match each other at the grid cell boundaries. The ability of the high-resolution RCM simulations (0.11°) to represent observed precipitation is assessed at their skillful scale, by aggregating the 0.11° grid to the 0.44° resolution and evaluating the added value with respect to the low resolution (0.44°) runs. Since RCMs are prone to systematic biases, the added value of the high resolution runs is also analyzed after applying bias correction methods to the RCMs. Gridded observational products are available over the same grids as the RCMs, such as the Spain02 v4 family of EURO-CORDEX-compliant gridded datasets over Spain. Therefore, the evaluation of the RCMs and the development of the SDMs can be carried out on exactly the same grids, and SDMs produce a downscaling output comparable to the RCMs. A set of SDMs (namely analog resampling, weather typing and different versions of Generalized Linear Models) are applied using ERA-Interim predictor variables under a cross-validation approach.\nResults show limited evidence for an added value of the high resolution RCM simulations in terms of seasonal mean biases. There is an indication of added value in the spatial patterns; however, this is not statistically significant after bias correcting both simulations. The comparison of RCMs and SDMs based on specific precipitation-derived indices may not be fair as long as they are related to parameters that have been optimized in the calibration phase of SDMs. When the comparison is performed in terms of non-optimized parameters (e.g. dry spells), both downscaling techniques present similar skills and limitations.\n","date":1463443200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1463443200,"objectID":"152f23631312b527a2aceca5a3d2c761","permalink":"https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2016-added-value-of-high-resolution/","publishdate":"2022-03-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/website-demo/event/2016-added-value-of-high-resolution/","section":"event","summary":"High resolution Regional Climate Model (RCM) simulations and Statistical Downscaling Methods (SDMs) are important tools to provide the meteorological variables required in climate impact assessments.

A key deliverable of VALUE is the development of a systematic validation framework to enable the assessment and comparison of both dynamical and statistical downscaling methods. This framework is based on a user-focused validation tree, guiding the selection of relevant validation indices and performance measures for different aspects of the validation (marginal, temporal, spatial, multi-variable). Moreover, several experiments have been designed to isolate specific points in the downscaling procedure where problems may occur (assessment of intrinsic performance, effect of errors inherited from the global models, effect of non-stationarity, etc.). The list of downscaling experiments includes 1) cross-validation with perfect predictors, 2) GCM predictors –aligned with EURO-CORDEX experiment– and 3) pseudo reality predictors (see Maraun et al. 2015, Earth’s Future, 3, doi:10.1002/2014EF000259, for more details). The results of these experiments are gathered, validated and publicly distributed through the VALUE validation portal, allowing for a comprehensive community-open downscaling intercomparison study.\nIn this contribution we describe the overall results from Experiment 1), consisting of a European wide 5- fold cross-validation (with consecutive 6-year periods from 1979 to 2008) using predictors from ERA-Interim to downscale precipitation and temperatures (minimum and maximum) over a set of 86 ECA\u0026amp;D stations representative of the main geographical and climatic regions in Europe. As a result of the open call for contribution to this experiment (closed in Dec. 2015), over 40 methods representative of the main approaches (MOS and Perfect Prognosis, PP) and techniques (linear scaling, quantile mapping, analogs, weather typing, linear and generalized regression, weather generators, etc.) were submitted, including information both data (downscaled values) and metadata (characterizing different aspects of the downscaling methods). This constitutes the largest and most comprehensive to date intercomparison of statistical downscaling methods. Here, we present an overall validation, analyzing marginal and temporal aspects to assess the intrinsic performance and added value of statistical downscaling methods at both annual and seasonal levels. This validation takes into account the different properties/limitations of different approaches and techniques (as reported in the provided metadata) in order to perform a fair comparison. It is pointed out that this experiment alone is not sufficient to evaluate the limitations of (MOS) bias correction techniques.

The ESCENA project (2008-2011) agglutinated the regional climate modelling efforts. Four different institutions contributed simulations using 4 different Regional Climate Models (RCMs): Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha (UCLM, PROMES model), Universidad de Murcia (UMUR, MM5 model), Universidad de Alcalá de Henares (UAHE, REMO model) and Universidad de Cantabria (UCAN, WRF model). The boundary forcing came from the Global Climate Model (GCM) simulations generated by the third Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) for the 4th IPCC Assessment Report (AR4). We used three different GCMs (ECHAM5-MPIOM, CNRM-CM3 and HadCM3) forced by the A1B, A2, and B1 emissions scenarios. An interesting feature of the experimental setup in ESCENA was the GCM/RCM matrix, which was designed to enable the comparison of different RCMs projections with a single specific change (RCM, scenario, GCM, parameterization). This allows the exploration of the role of different sources of uncertainty. The RCM simulations cover a common minimum domain encompassing the whole Spanish territory with a horizontal resolution of 25 Km. The project focused on the near future, simulating a control period (1950-2000, 1950 left as spin-up and disregarded in the analyses) forced by the 20C3M historical scenario and continued by a 50-year period, 2001-2050, of future projection.

We apply different bias correction methods (from the simple scaling to different versions of the quantile-quantile mapping) directly to daily precipitation from a set of coarse resolution CMIP5 GCMs and compare them with bias-corrected EURO-CORDEX RCMs (namely COSMO-CLM and RCA at 12km horizontal resolution) for historical and future periods. We use a subset of European stations from the ECA\u0026amp;D dataset as observational reference for the bias correction. Additionally, a refined analysis in the Ebro catchment illustrates the effect of bias correction on spatial climate variability.\nThe evaluation experiment of the historical simulations in a cross-validation framework shows that bias corrected RCMs and GCMs typically present similar biases, but an added value of RCMs is found for the spatial analysis. Second, the basic features and the overall magnitude of the climate change signal are preserved after applying bias correction, although in some cases the uncertainty in the climate change signal is amplified by bias correction.\n","date":1426032e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1426032e3,"objectID":"53ddf5d61173e39cdd3e2288e8cc0d10","permalink":"https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2015-assessing-the-role-of-regional/","publishdate":"2022-03-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/website-demo/event/2015-assessing-the-role-of-regional/","section":"event","summary":"Recently, the amount of publicly available future climate simulations has greatly increased, allowing for more robust climate change uncertainty assessments.

The last few decades though, the number of forest fires has significantly increased, as well as their severity and impact on the environment. Local fire danger projections are often required when dealing with wild fire research. In the present study the application of statistical downscaling and spatial interpolation methods was performed to the Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI), in order to assess forest fire risk in Greece. The FWI is used worldwide (including the Mediterranean basin) to estimate the fire danger in a generalized fuel type, based solely on weather observations. The meteorological inputs to the FWI System are noon values of dry-bulb temperature, air relative humidity, 10m wind speed and precipitation during the previous 24 hours. The statistical downscaling methods are based on a statistical model that takes into account empirical relationships between large scale variables (used as predictors) and local scale variables. In the framework of the current study the statistical downscaling portal developed by the Santander Meteorology Group (https://www.meteo.unican.es/downscaling) in the framework of the EU project CLIMRUN (www.climrun.eu) was used to downscale non standard parameters related to forest fire risk. In this study, two different approaches were adopted. Firstly, the analogue downscaling technique was directly performed to the FWI index values and secondly the same downscaling technique was performed indirectly through the meteorological inputs of the index. In both cases, the statistical downscaling portal was used considering the ERA-Interim reanalysis as predictands due to the lack of observations at noon. Additionally, a three-dimensional (3D) interpolation method of position and elevation, based on Thin Plate Splines (TPS) was used, to interpolate the ERA-Interim data used to calculate the index. Results from this method were compared with the statistical downscaling results obtained from the portal.

Extremes can be evaluated both by using extreme value theory or deriving extreme indicators, which are usually based on statistics on the tail of the probability distribution. Some of the most commonly used indicators are based on percentiles. In this study we calculate the most extreme percentiles in maximum (90p, 95p and 99p) and minimum (1p, 5p and 10p) temperature derived from the application of dynamical downscaling methods in the Iberian Peninsula. We analyze the regional climate models (RCMs) of the ENSEMBLES (EU-funded) and ESCENA (strategic action of Plan Nacional de I+D+i 2008-2011 funded by the Spanish government) projects.\nThe dynamical downscaling methods are first tested in present climate with quasi-perfect (reanalysis) boundary conditions in order to know to what extent these approaches properly reproduce the observed percentiles. Then, we analyze the effect of nesting the RCMs to different Global Circulation Models (GCMs) on the 20C3M scenario. The study focuses on the end of the 20th century (1961–2000), used as a reference period, and assesses the changes projected for the period 2031–2050 considering the A1B emission scenario.\nThe comparison among the different models is obtained in terms of both the annual and seasonal biases. Analyzing the bias patterns, we are able to know whether the inter-RCM variability leads to larger biases than those due to the driving GCM.

The heterogeneity of architectures and systems along with the different configuration schemas has led to a situation where users find very complicated taking advantage of all the resources available.\nIn order to solve this problem, a new computing paradigm called “Grid Computing” appeared as an alternative for flexible access to heterogeneous and geographically distributed computing resources. Typically, creating a Grid infrastructure requires coordination among cluster administrators and the installation of a middleware to unify the access to them.\nNowadays, users have access to some resources, like HPC infrastructures, which are not shared using any Grid middleware. Under this situation, the user has to manage separately the access to each non-Grid infrastructure, which is quite cumbersome.\nThe challenge of this work is to unify the access to Grid and non-Grid resources, allowing researchers to perform huge experiments making use of all the available resources. To achieve this goal, common LRMs used in HPC infrastructures: PBS/Torque, SGE and SLURM and Grid middleware: gLite, GT2.4 and GT4/5 has been considered.\nAlthough nowadays there are several Grid meta-schedulers, none of them has the capabilities needed. To solve the problem of unified access to Grid and non-Grid resources, the GridWay meta-scheduler and his plugin oriented architecture has been used.\nMoreover, as Gridway doesn’t provide access to non Grid resources, new GridWay plugins which grant access to non-Grid resources (PBS/Torque, SGE and SLURM) have been developed. These plugins are based on the raw access to clusters provided to the users; typically a ssh account and LRM’s CLI.\nAs an application of this tool it has been integrated into the WRF4G framework. WRF is high demanding application of HPC resources. WRF4G is a framework that allows the management of the execution of huge experiments, consisting in thousands of jobs (HTC). With this tool we are providing a homogeneous access to Grid and non-Grid resources to the WRF4G users.\nThe Earth Sciences community, in particular Climate \u0026amp; Weather community, is high demanding HPC user community, therefore it will benefit from this unification of Grid and non-Grid resources.\n","date":1301788800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1301788800,"objectID":"5b79cf35f4c72a48f7295a12a3d0ad90","permalink":"https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2011-aggregation-of-grid-and-hpc/","publishdate":"2022-03-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/website-demo/event/2011-aggregation-of-grid-and-hpc/","section":"event","summary":"The explosion of computer power during the last two decades has increased the number and types of computational resources a researcher has access to.

In the area of Galicia (NW Spain) this trend has also been determined. The main objective of this work is to assess actual and future trends of different extreme indices of temperature, which are of crucial importance for many impact studies.\nAs direct GCM-output significantly underestimates the variance of daily surface temperature variables in NW Spain, these are obtained by applying a statistical downscaling technique (analog method), using 850hPa temperature and mean sea level pressure as combined predictors. The predictor fields have been extracted from a multi-model multi initial conditions ensemble of 14 runs of three GCMs participating in the IPCC AR4.\nFor 1960-2006 results show a significant increase of the number of days with maximum temperatures above the 90th percentile. Furthermore, a significant decrease of the days with maximum temperatures below the 10th percentile has been found. The tendencies of minimum temperatures are reverse: less nights with minimum temperatures below the 10th percentile and more with minimum temperatures above 90th percentile. Those tendencies can be observed all over the year, but are more pronounced in summer. Results for relationship between the above mentioned extreme values and different North Atlantic teleconnection patterns show that local tendencies are associated with trends of EA (Eastern Atlantic) and SCA (Scandinavian) patterns. The NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation) only in winter is related to the number of cold days.\nThe ensemble climate projections generated with the analog method indicate that the observed (linear) trends of maximum and minimum temperatures in NW Spain are expected to continue in the next decades. Furthermore the uncertainty interval of these projections (2021-2050) is dominated by model uncertainties rather than by forcing uncertainties.\nWe conclude that more frequent hot days as well as an increasing probability of summertime heat waves are to be expected in the next decades. Cold days tend to diminish, decreasing the probability of wintertime cold waves and leaving a greater part of the area under study without frost throughout the year.\n","date":1254096e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1254096e3,"objectID":"c0d949957886c26ef1e101255407f065","permalink":"https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2009-actual-and-future-trends-of/","publishdate":"2022-03-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/website-demo/event/2009-actual-and-future-trends-of/","section":"event","summary":"It is now very well established that yearly averaged temperatures are increasing due to anthropogenic climate change.

Components of the wave climate are variables such as wind velocity, W, wind direction, θW, significant wave height, Hs, peak period, Tp, and mean wave direction, θ. Usually, the classical analysis of the long-term distribution of wave climate is addressed using just one variable (f.i., long-term distribution of significant wave height) or at most bidimensionally (f.i., the bidimensional distribution of Hs and Tp). It is clear that the joint probability distribution of these five variables (Hs, Tp, θ, W, θW) is not easy to able to cope with. However, this problem is solved applying a non-linear clustering algorithm, namely the Self Organizing Maps (SOM), a neural network technique capable of classifying the high dimensional input reanalysis data in a low number of centroids (clusters) in an ordered sheet shape representation (Camus et al, 2007). The neurons are connected to adjacent elements by a neighbourhood relation. A multidimensional histogram of the sea state parameters is obtained allowing an easy further treatment of the classified sea states.\nFigure 1 shows a 23x23 SOM applied to a particular site located in Villano, Galicia (Spain). In this case, the original data space has been projected into a toroid lattice being the data accommodated in a circular way. This toroid shape has been again projected into the plane for a better visualization, separating the centroids which are located together, the centroids located in the upper side of the sheet are joined with the centroids located on the lower side of the sheet and with the lateral sides in the 3D-dimension. Each cell of the SOM represents a cluster defined by the five parameters employed in the classification. The significant wave height, the wave period and the wave direction are represented by the size, the colour intensity and the direction of the arrow; the pink arrow represents the wind vector. The background of each hexagon has been filled in a blue scale, function of the frequency of occurrence. As it can be seen in the figure, this classification technique is capable of extracting all the possible sea states and the transition between them. The magnitudes of the parameters which define the centroids vary smoothly from one cell to another. The most energetic sea states present W-WNW directions (i=17, j=14). The higher amount of data is grouped in clusters with low energy sea states (i=6, j=11).\nFigure 2 shows several SOMs for different locations along the northern coast of Spain. In this case, we are considering (Hs, Tp, θ) and a 10x10 SOM. In the presentation, the theoretical basis and some examples will show the ability of this methodology to describe the multidimensional wave climate.\n","date":1242e6,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1242e6,"objectID":"c24656f3fb96a58792af689d76d4a4c2","permalink":"https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2009-analysing-the-multidimensional-wave-climate/","publishdate":"2022-03-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/website-demo/event/2009-analysing-the-multidimensional-wave-climate/","section":"event","summary":"The term “wave climate” usually refers to the statistical distribution of several oceanographical geophysical variables.

Finalmente, se muestra la forma de mejorar la resolución de una predicción realizada por el modelo numérico a partir de la estadística de los meteoros locales observados en las fechas correspondientes a los análogos hallados para el estado definido por la predicción.\n","date":1006214400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1006214400,"objectID":"59ec86a975b2e30572a6830767e190b0","permalink":"https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/2001-aplicacion-de-metodos-de-clasificacion/","publishdate":"2022-03-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/website-demo/event/2001-aplicacion-de-metodos-de-clasificacion/","section":"event","summary":"En este artículo se analizan diversas alternativas para la predicción probabilística de meteoros utilizando el método de análogos, y se presentan resultados de validación en la red principal de estaciones del INM en las diversas cuencas peninsulares.","tags":["Statistical downscaling"],"title":"Aplicación de Métodos de Clasificación al Downscaling Estadístico","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/website-demo/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/website-demo/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b0d61e5cbb7472bf320bf0ef2aaeb977","permalink":"https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/tour/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/website-demo/tour/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tour","type":"widget_page"}]

The graph defines a factorization of the Joint Probability Distribution (JPD) which allows to efficiently perform probabilistic inferencer. Static BNs have been already applied as statistical downscaling methods; in this case, the nodes represent stations (local observations) and the links the spatial dependencies among them. Moreover, an extra node representing the atmospheric state (weather types) is included as an evidential variable (the future value is known). Therefore, the posterior distribution of the stations can be directly computed from a predicted weather type using the BN. The standard analogue method is the simplest case where no spatial dependencies are considered (it corresponds to a Naive Bayes inverse classifier). In this paper we study daily rainfall occurrence over the Iberian Peninsula and ERA-40 reanalysis. <\/p>\n<p>Different statistical learning methods allow to automatically obtain a graph and the corresponding JPD from data. We have applied different standard learning algorithms (K2 and B) to infer BNs from data and to downscale rainfall occurrence obtaining a probabilistic forecast. In this case, no significant improvement over a standard analog method is achieved (the stations tend to be independent given the atmospheric state variable). We show that this result is a consequence of the static character of BNs. Thus, we analyze the different extensions of BNs to include temporal dependencies. <\/p>\n<p>The most popular dynamic extension of BNs considers a sequence of time slices corresponding to different snapshots in time of the same static BN, connected by temporal links (Dynamical Bayesian Networks, DBN). Both spatial intra-slice and dynamic inter-slice connections can be imposed or learnt from data according to different strategies. We have compared static and dynamic models considering three different approaches. The first method is a two step algorithm where we first learn a common structure for the time slices (static model) and then the inter-slice connections. In the second approach, both intra and inter-slice connections are learnt simultaneously. In these two cases only a few inter-slice connections are established, since spatial relationships tend to be stronger than the temporal ones at daily basis. In order to favour dynamic relationships, in the last approach, we learn inter-slice connections before the intra-slice ones. This third approach obtained the best results in terms of ROC skill area. As a conclusion we show that the analog downscaling approach can be naturally extended to include both spatial and temporal relationships using the framework of DBNs. The validation results show a small average improvement of the skill; however, for certain stations (those with poorest analog skill), a significant improvement has been obtained.<\/p>"

            "drupal_node_body" : "<p>Sediments can act as sinks of multiple chemicals that accumulate over time, making risk assessment and sustainable management difficult and complex. The assessment of sediment quality should therefore be carried out through tiered decision-making frameworks in sequential steps of increasing complexity and cost. Therefore, the development of tools to link chemical concentrations of contaminants to the potential for observing toxicity is of great interest, since these tools can be very useful in initial assessment steps for an efficient allocation of limited resources; e.g., they can serve to identify uncontaminated sediments with low probability of toxicity, in which further testing would not be necessary, or to identify sediments that are highly likely to be toxic and would require attention in subsequent management steps. <\/p>\n<p>Some existing approaches, such as the Logistic Regression Models (LRM)<sup>1<\/sup> or the widely used empirical Sediment Quality Guidelines<sup>2-3<\/sup>, focus on estimating toxicity based on individual-contaminant models, which can be problematic since many chemicals occur together and the toxicity of the sediment is the product of complex interactions among them. The objective of this study is to present a new alternative approach in which advanced machine learning techniques based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs<sup>4<\/sup>) are used to model the probability of toxicity responses from sediment chemistry, considering the concentrations of the most commonly analyzed contaminants simultaneously and their interactions.<\/p>\n<p>Available historical data from the U.S. EPA’s Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) were compiled, and after thorough processes of data verification and screening, a large database of 1552 field-collected sediment samples with matching chemistry and toxicity data was prepared. The resulting database contained information on 9 metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Hg, Ni, Ag, Zn) and 10 organic chemicals (low molecular weight PAHs, high molecular weight PAHs, PCBs, p,p’-DDD, p,p’-DDE, p,p’-DDT, TBT, hexachlorobenzene, alpha-chlordane and lindane), while sediment toxicity was evaluated in 10-day survival tests using the amphipod Ampelisca abdita.<\/p>\n<p>Different data preprocessing techniques and different configurations of network architectures (Multi Layer Perceptrons) were tested performing cross-validation experiments, and the quality of the predictions was assessed using measures of resolution and reliability. The resulting models were compared to LRM obtaining a better classification performance both in terms of sensitivity (ability to correctly classify a toxic sample as toxic) and specificity (ability to correctly classify a nontoxic sample as nontoxic). Moreover, the economic value curves derived from the ANN models proved to be useful screening tools for sustainable sediment management, allowing decision makers to achieve the desired compromises between environmental protection (i.e. high sensitive) and efficient use of resources (i.e. high specificity to avoid wasting money and effort incorrectly considering nontoxic samples for further testing).<\/p>\n<hr noshade=\"noshade\">\n<i>References:<\/i><br \/>\n<sup>1<\/sup> Field et al. 2002.

To this aim we present a recent characterization of spatiotemporal error growth (the so called mean-variance logarithmic (MVL) diagram, Primo et al. 2005, Gutiérrez et al. 2008). Behind a simple calculation procedure, the MVL diagram comes from a sound theoretical basis borrowed from the growth of rough interfaces (López et al. 2004), and has several applications as a diagnostic tool in the characterization of ensemble prediction systems. Namely, it is useful in characterizing (1) the initial perturbations applied in a simulation, (2) the model dynamics, acting as a fingerprint for different models and (3) the climatological fluctuations of the perturbations specific of each model. As opposite to the standard temporal analysis (spatially-averaged or single-point), the MVL spatiotemporal analysis accounts for the nontrivial localization of fluctuations, thus allowing disentangling the effects of the different initialization procedures (random, lagged, singular vectors) and the different model formulations.<br \/>\nWe show an application of this diagram using a coupled ocean-atmosphere Ensemble Prediction System (Fernández et al. 2009); in particular we consider the DEMETER multimodel seasonal hindcast and focus on both initial conditions (three different perturbation procedures) and model errors (seven coupled GCMs). We show that the shared building blocks of the GCMs (atmospheric and ocean components) impose similar dynamics among different models and, thus, contribute to poorly sampling the model formulation uncertainty. We also illustrate how multiple scales in dynamical systems impose non-trivial effects on the growth of perturbations.<\/p>"

On one hand, this is a first step toward the selection of physical parameterizations to be run in the long term to produce CORDEX-compliant simulations for Africa using WRF. For this purpose, the simulation results were validated with gridded surface observations (e.g. from CRU and TRMM satellite precipitation rates) and ERA-Interim reanalysis. On the other hand, the study assesses the spread of the multi-physics ensemble for different key variables (to be compared with the multi-model spread) and the relative results of each ensemble member with respect to the control member. The larger impacts on the simulations were related to the boundary layer and soil schemes.<\/p>"

This region is especially interesting because of its heterogeneous<br \/>\ntopography and climate in a relative small domain. In addition to Spain, ESCENA will provide useful information<br \/>\nregarding climate change projections for countries like Portugal and Morocco. The resulting database will be<br \/>\npublicly available after the project is finished. Four groups are involved in this project: the University of Cantabria<br \/>\n(UC), the University of Murcia (UM), the University of Castilla-La Mancha (UCLM) and the University of Alcalá<br \/>\nde Henares (UAH). ESCENA will produce a dataset comparable with the RCM products generated within the<br \/>\nPRUDENCE (2001-2004) and ENSEMBLES (2004-2009) European projects, using the same resolution as in ENSEMBLES<br \/>\n(25 km). It complements the ENSEMBLES dataset through the use of improved or additional RCMs<br \/>\n(PROMES, WRF, MM5 and REMO), nested in three Global Climate Models (GCMs) (HadCM3, ECHAM5<br \/>\nand ARPEGE) and a larger set of emissions scenarios (A1B, A2 and B1), giving as a result an almost complete<br \/>\nmatrix of GCM\/RCM combinations. Another important difference with respect to ENSEMBLES is the simulation<br \/>\ndomain, which is centered over the Iberian Peninsula and covers parts of the Atlantic Ocean, including the Canary<br \/>\nIslands, which were not included in these European projects.<\/p>\n<p>The project includes an evaluation present climate simulation (1990-2007) forced by the higher resolution<br \/>\nERA-Interim reanalysis, instead of the ERA-40 reanalysis used in ENSEMBLES. This simulation has been compared<br \/>\nwith the improved Spain02 reference data (0.2º). This database was developed following the ENSEMBLES<br \/>\nE-OBS database methodology but using a much larger amount of daily station data. Thus, it is very suitable<br \/>\nover this area to be compared with high resolution RCMs data at daily timescale. The main part of the project is<br \/>\ndevoted to the generation of climate change scenario simulations (1950-2050) applicable to impact models due to<br \/>\nits high resolution. Results of mean and extreme fields from the evaluation present climate simulations compared<br \/>\nwith Spain02 data are analyzed in an associated contribution (Jiménez-Guerrero et al., 2011) also presented in this<br \/>\nGeneral Assembly.<\/p>"

Further<br \/>\ndescriptions of this project can be found in an associated work (Domínguez et al., 2011) also presented in this<br \/>\nGeneral Assembly.<\/p>\n<p>The objective of this contribution is to describe the mean fields, the interannual variability and extremes<br \/>\nfor temperature and precipitation for an ensemble of simulations forced by the high resolution ERA-Interim<br \/>\nreanalysis. The results for these variables and indices from the ERA-Interim-forced simulations (1990-2007) are<br \/>\ncompared to the Spain02 reference data set. This database was developed following the ENSEMBLES E-OBS<br \/>\ndatabase methodology but using a much larger amount of daily station data. Thus, it is very suitable over the<br \/>\nIberian Peninsula to be compared with high resolution RCMs data at daily timescale.<br \/>\nMaximum surface air temperature shows cold biases in all models up to -4 K, with relatively clear signal<br \/>\nthat the modelled maximum temperature is severely underestimated during the coldest seasons, while these biases<br \/>\nreduce to -3 K during summertime (JJA). Generally, there is a better agreement between observed and simulated<br \/>\nminimum surface air temperature, which is mainly overestimated in the simulations especially during wintertime<br \/>\n(DJF). Regarding precipitation, the models tend to show low dry biases during all seasons, especially for autumn in<br \/>\nthe Mediterranean coast of the Iberian Peninsula. With respect to the interannual variability, the PROMES simulations<br \/>\noverestimate the standard deviation of maximum surface air temperature when compared against the Spain02<br \/>\ndata, particularly during spring (MAM) and JJA; while the rest of models tend to slightly underestimate the<br \/>\ninterannual variability. For precipitation, the agreement between observed and simulated interannual variability is<br \/>\nbetter than for temperature in all seasons. All models tend to overestimate the Spain02 standard deviation. In DJF,<br \/>\nthe differences in the interannual variability are the highest between models both for temperature and precipitation.<br \/>\nThe precipitation frequency distributions have been analyzed as well as several precipitation and temperature<br \/>\nclimate extreme indices related to the spatial features of Iberian Peninsula. The study of some particular<br \/>\nextreme events (1994 and 2000 droughts and 2003 heatwave) is also shown. Most of the analyses have been<br \/>\nperformed for basins. The shape of the simulated precipitation frequency distribution is in good accordance with<br \/>\nthe Spain02 data and the specific behaviour differs among models. The frequency and intensity precipitation<br \/>\nindices present very different spatial patterns, showing the intensity indices a lower spread. Very hot and cold days<br \/>\nand nights have been studied through the maximum and minimum temperature indices. Generally, the models<br \/>\nunderestimate the temperature for cold days (between 1-5 K depending on the model and basin). The models have<br \/>\nsimulated more properly the 2000 drought than that of 1994 when compared to Spain02 data. The 2003 heatwave<br \/>\nthat affected particularly the northeastern region of the Iberian Peninsula can be observed in Spain02 data. Most<br \/>\nmodels have a combined summer days and tropical nights index anomaly similar to Spain02 data, with values<br \/>\nhigher than 9 days in the most affected basins.<\/p>\n<p>Hence, the results point out the ability of these RCMs to reproduce the mean fields, the interannual variability<br \/>\nand climatic extremes in a very complex terrain such as the Iberian Peninsula, showing a great diversity of<br \/>\nclimatic behaviours.<\/p>"

These include mainly evaluation studies, which provide context for the future climate scenarios. Multi-physics ensembles have been widely used along with multi-model ensembles produced by the CORDEX community. The evaluation was carried out against process-related variables using basic measures. This procedure revealed important biases, not only in surface variables but also in key variables regarding the energy flux. Multi-physics ensembles are an important tool to address model biases and to aid in model development, in contrast to multi-model ensembles of opportunity. The role of increased model resolution was also analysed over Spain using the Spain011\/044 as reference data set, revealing very limited improvement with resolution in standard evaluation scores.<br \/>\nTwo of the main challenges of the project were the coupling of WRF with an interactive ocean component and the use of geographically distributed computing resources to accomplish regional climate simulations. The advances in these areas within CORWES will also be presented.<br \/>\nFinally, the future scenarios available for Iberia will be presented from the perspective of the European and African CORDEX domains.<\/p>"

This heterogeneous (and sometimes contradictory) global and statistical\/dynamically downscaled data has been used as primary input to feed vulnerability, impacts and adaptation (VIA) studies.<\/p>\n<p>Over Europe, regional climate downscaling output from EU FP7 ENSEMBLES and CORDEX has become available in the last 10 years. Additionally, national efforts have produced additional information for particular regions. For instance, the National Adaptation Program for Climate Change (PNACC-2012) produced two additional datasets of statistical and dynamically downscaled scenarios for Spain. Even though such initiatives have promoted coordination, the ensembles produced remain as ensembles of opportunity, in the sense that their experimental design does not favour the systematic study of different sources of uncertainty. In any case, this is the information available to assess climate change. Even though new models, or even new processes, are included in the most recent MIPs, previous efforts still contain valid, and widely unexplored, information.<\/p>\n<p>This work focuses on simple, common analyses, based on temperature and precipitation delta changes, arising from three recent regional MIPs which produced future climate information over continental Spain. The main focus is on analysing different sources of uncertainty (GHG scenarios, GCMs, downscaling approaches, and spatial resolution) and compare the common or conflicting messages arising from the available datasets. The work is based on publicly available data provided by the ENSEMBLES, EURO-CORDEX, and the Spanish PNACC2012 initiatives. The latter used roughly the same global (CMIP3) and downscaling model generation as ENSEMBLES. However, additional GHG scenarios were considered. CORDEX relies on the latest generation of scenarios and models (CMIP5), reaching unprecedented spatial resolution over the area. The grand ensemble contains over 100 future projections for the region, including those downscaled at different resolutions and the raw output of their driving GCMs. This is a great source of potential information, but conflicting messages necessarily appear and need to be understood by both the climate and VIA communities.<\/p>"

These indices combine two or more essential climate variables that are frequently individually corrected prior to the CI calculation. This poses the question of whether the bias correction (BC) method modifies the inter-variable dependencies and eventually the climate change signal. The direct bias correction of the multi-variate CI stands as an alternative, since it preserves the physical and temporal coherence among the primary variables as represented in the dynamical model output. This comes at the expense of incorporating the individual biases on the CI computation with an effect difficult to foresee, particularly in the case of complex CIs bearing in their formulation non-linear relationships between components. Such is the case of the Fire Weather Index (FWI), a meteorological fire danger indicator frequently used in forest fire prevention and research. <\/p>\n<p>In the present work, we test the suitability of the direct BC approach on FWI as a representative multi-variate CI, assessing its performance in present climate conditions and its effect on the climate change signal when applied to future projections. Moreover, the results are compared with the common approach of correcting the input variables separately. To this aim, we apply the widely used empirical quantile mapping method (QM). We introduce the percentile adjustment function (PAF) as a tool to provide insight into the effect of the QM on the climate change signal. Although both approaches present similar results under present climate, the direct correction introduces a greater modification of the original change signal. These results warn against the blind use of QM, even in the case of essential climate variables or uni-variate CIs.<\/p>"

It will foster cooperation with the impacts and user community to obtain actionable climate information from different sources, including both statistical and dynamical downscaling. Regarding the latter, we designed an experimental setup exploring the uncertainties arising from the use of (1) different regional climate models and configurations (ETA, RegCM4, WRF3.8, WRF3.9), (2) different resolutions, with an intermediate resolution nest (20km) to reach convection-permitting resolution (4km) over the target area, (3) different heavy precipitation events and (4) different simulation setups, comparing a “Weather-like” mode, benefiting from predictability arising from initial conditions as in NWP, and a “climate mode”, where predictability arises only from the lateral boundary conditions. These driving boundary conditions are taken in all cases from the ERA-Interim reanalysis, in order to compare with observations and leave out global climate modelling uncertainty.<br \/>\nIn this work, we present some initial results focusing only on precipitation and exploring the above mentioned uncertainty sources. In particular, we focus on the ability of the models to represent the diurnal cycle of precipitation, total precipitation amount and spatial distribution as compared to the driving reanalysis and several station and gridded observational datasets over the region.<\/p>"

Al analizar la frecuencia anual media para todas las estaciones, se observó una tendencia significativa decreciente  de aproximadamente medio día de nieve al año desde el año 1975; se analizaron también correlaciones con tendencias de temperatura media y ocurrencia de precipitación.<\/p>\n<p>En la segunda parte del trabajo se analizó la conexión de la ocurrencia de nieve con campos meteorológicos a gran escala, simulados por modelos de circulación general mediante métodos de downscaling estadístico (en particular, técnicas de análogos y de clasificación de tiempo). Debido a la baja frecuencia climatológica de la ocurrencia de nieve, se calculó un umbral específico para cada estación con el fin de obtener predicciones deterministas, obteniéndose tasas de acierto en torno al 60% y falsas alarmas en torno al 2% para la predicción diaria. Este método es capaz de simular extraordinariamente bien la frecuencia anual de días de nieve (mediante técnicas de validación cruzada), tanto la tendencia decreciente como la variabilidad interanual.<\/p>\n<p>Con el fin de analizar la estacionariedad del método, se realizaron dos nuevos experimentos en los que se utilizó como período de entrenamiento únicamente los diez años consecutivos más fríos (1970-1980) y los diez más cálidos (1992-2002). En ambos casos se logró reproducir con bastante exactitud tanto la tendencia como la variabilidad interanual del periodo restante. Estos resultados sugieren la posibilidad de analizar escenarios futuros de tendencia de nieve en un contexto de cambio climático mediante este método. También se describirán los trabajos preliminares realizados con simulaciones de modelos climáticos del Cuarto Informe de Evaluación (AR4) del IPCC, para obtener proyecciones futuras de las tendencias observadas.<\/p>"

En una primera fase de este proyecto se ha completado una climatología de alta resolución de la región a escala diaria (10km utilizando sólo observaciones, y 1km introduciendo también co-variables orográficas: altura, pendiente, bloqueos, etc.), evaluando la incertidumbre introducida por los distintos métodos. En una segunda fase, se han aplicado distintas técnicas de downscaling estadístico a las series de observaciones y también a las series interpoladas: regresión lineal utilizando Componentes Principales (CPs), regresión lineal con valores de rejilla en puntos cercanos, regresión lineal condicionada a tipos de tiempo, y distintas variantes del método de análogos. Con todos estos métodos se ha formado un conjunto de predicciones para cuantificar la incertidumbre introducida por el método de downscaling, frente a la incertidumbre introducida por lo modelos globales; en este estudio se han utilizando distintos modelos globales del AR4 como predictores (ECHAM5, CNRM-CM3, HADCM3, etc.), trabajando a escala diaria. También se han comparado los resultados obtenidos al utilizar las observaciones, frente a los obtenidos al utilizar datos interpolados, mostrando resultados equivalentes. La fuente de incertidumbre más importante ha resultado ser la proveniente de los distintos modelos globales, mostrando que es necesario considerar predicciones multi-modelo si se quiere cuantificar de forma apropiada la incertidumbre, tanto a nivel global como regional. También se muestran algunos resultados sobre la robustez de las técnicas estadísticas cuando se aplican a escenarios futuros, en los que las relaciones empíricas aprendidas en clima presente podrían no ser apropiadas.<\/p>"

This method provides an estimation of the statistical significance of the skill and, hence, allows us to find out predictable situations where the seasonal system significantly outperforms a random forecast. We also analyze the advantages of post-processing the predictions with some appropriate statistical downscaling method. The method is applied to precipitation and temperature forecasts considering two regions with different seasonal behavior: Peru (in the tropics) and Spain (mid-latitudes). Results show high predictability over Peru during El Nino periods. Here, the use of a downscaling method clearly improves the forecast skill. Over Spain the forecast signal is much weaker, but some predictability related to El Nino and La Nina events is found.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, some sensitivity studies are presented. On the one hand, we compare raw station data with high resolution gridded interpolated data.

Several applications areas as high energy physics or bio-applications have been proven to beneﬁt from this computational paradigm. Applications from the Earth Science community are starting to take advantage of this technology (see e.g. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eu-degree.eu\" title=\"www.eu-degree.eu\">www.eu-degree.eu<\/a>). The port of already existing Earth Science applications and, in particular, a numerical atmospheric model to the GRID poses a challenge in terms of the CPU and storage requirements. These applications are organized around communities known as virtual organizations (VO).<br \/>\nThe limited area models require a large amount of input data to build the boundary conditions. Currently the heterogenous GRID infrastructure is subject to common failures and intermittent availability of resources the numerical weather models are not prepared for. For those reasons, in this contribution we present a new execution framework providing a software wrapper for a numerical prediction model. A wrapper for the WRF Modeling<br \/>\nSystem has been developed to enable limited area model simulations on the GRID. This WRF for the GRID wrapper (WRF4G) is \"gridifying\" a complex workﬂow application as the WRF System.<br \/>\nThe WRF4G framework has been adapted for the middleware developed in the leading european project on GRID computing known as EGEE (<a href=\"http:\/\/eu-egee.org\/\" title=\"http:\/\/eu-egee.org\/\">http:\/\/eu-egee.org\/<\/a>), also used in other GRID european projects (EELA2, ...) and National GRID Initiatives (NGI) like the Spanish NGI (ES-NGI). This GRID environment provides a High Productive Computing allowing to run multiple independent jobs with no high demanding on CPU and memory resources.<br \/>\nAs an application of the WRF4G framework we present a multi-physics ensemble experiment of precipitation forecast over Spain, which is run daily at a 10km resolution by the Santander Meteorology Group (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meteo.unican.es\" title=\"www.meteo.unican.es\">www.meteo.unican.es<\/a>).

This study was based on observations of annual snow frequency (measured as the annual number of snow days) from a network of 33 stations ranging from 60 to 1350 meters. In the present work we analyze the skill of dynamical downscaling methods to reproduce this trend in present climate conditions and also to further project it into the future from A1B-scenario global simulations. In particular, we consider the regional simulation dataset from the ENSEMBLES project, consisting in ten state-of-the-art Regional Climate Models (RCMs) at 25km resolution run with different forcing\/boundary conditions. To this aim we first test the regional models with perfect boundaries considering ERA40; it is shown that after correcting the bias, all the RCMs  appropriately reproduce the interannual variability and the observed trends (e.g., the ensemble mean presents a trend of -5.8 days\/decade). Then we analyze the results for the present climate 20c3m-scenario global simulations. In this case, the results are quite variable with the larger uncertainty being associated with the particular GCM used (ECHAM5, CNRM or HadCM) with trends ranging from -6.7 to -1.8 days\/decade. Finally, the trends obtained for the future 2010-2040 A1B runs range from -5.7 to -1.4 days\/decade, indicating a continuous decrease of snow frequency in this region.<\/p>\n<p>References:<\/p>\n<p>Pons, M.R., D.

To this aim we first present a recent characterization of spatiotemporal error growth (the so called mean-variance logarithmic (MVL) diagram, Primo et al. 2005, Gutiérrez et al. 2008) and then we describe an application using coupled ocean-atmosphere Ensemble Prediction Systems (Fernández et al. 2009); in particular we consider the DEMETER multimodel seasonal hindcast (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ecmwf.int\/research\/demeter\/\" title=\"http:\/\/www.ecmwf.int\/research\/demeter\/\">http:\/\/www.ecmwf.int\/research\/demeter\/<\/a>) and focus on both initial conditions (three different perturbation procedures) and model errors (seven coupled GCMs). We show that, as opposite to the standard temporal analysis (spatially-averaged or single-point), the MVL spatiotemporal analysis accounts for the nontrivial localization of fluctuations, thus allowing disentangling the effects of the different initialization procedures (random, lagged, singular vectors) and the different model formulations. For instance, it is shown that the shared building blocks of the GCMs (atmospheric and ocean components) impose similar dynamics among different models and, thus, contribute to poorly sampling the model formulation uncertainty. <\/p>\n<p>References: <\/p>\n<p>C.

These datasets are used by a wide range of end-users from different socio-economic sectors (agriculture, energy, etc.) to produce different impact studies. Typically, these datasets are distributed in different repositories, using different data conventions, tables of variables and storage systems. Moreover, a number of post-processing algorithms (bias removal, interpolation, calibration with observations, etc.) are typically applied to the data before using the resulting time series for a particular application. In practise, this post-processing step may be a time-consuming problem for some end-users, who are not familiar with standard meteorological formats and with interpolation procedures. Therefore, the apparently simple task of obtaining a simulated data field (e.g. total precipitation) at the required temporal aggregation (e.g. weekly) interpolated to a specific lon-lat point (e.g. to Madrid, Spain) may result a hard task for some users. The DAP has been designed to facilitate this task through a user-friendly Web portal, so end-users can interactively chose the desired model (reanalysis or GCM outputs in the original DAP version), the local points and the post-processing methods to be applied to the interpolated series, obtaining the resulting data in simple formats (e.g. a text or Excel file). The ENSEBMLES DAP has not been designed for massive data interpolation and post-processing and, thus, different restrictions apply for an appropriate use. <\/p>\n<p>In order to contribute to the CORDEX initiative, an extension of the ENSEMBLES DAP is being implemented to include RCM data (initially, the ENSEMBLES 25km RCMs). This is done by remotely linking the portal to the OPeNDAP server, thus keeping the dataset up-to-date, and easily allowing future connections to other CORDEX datasets. In this talk we present the functionalities of the portal and the future plans.<\/p>"

This is especially true for Spain, which is geographically complex and heterogeneous and it is characterized by a great variability of precipitation (Serrano et al. 1999, Trigo and Palutikof, 2001). Consequently, developing regional climate scenarios is a key aspect for any impact and adaptation study to climate change in Spain.<br \/>\nIn contrary to the traditional approach in which the statistical downscaling has been considered as an alternative to dynamical downscaling, we used the two kinds of downscaling approaches together in order to combine their advantages. This hybrid approach is becoming popular (Maraun et al. 2010, Piani et al. 2010, Quintana Seguí et al 2010, Themeßl et al. 2010) thank to the better skill of RCMs (e.g. Herrera et al. 2010a) and the increase of availability of RCMs (e.g. due to projects like ENSEMBLES).<br \/>\nIn this study, the fields of precipitation simulated by an ensemble of RCMs are statistically post-processed in order to downscale and to calibrate their precipitation fields using the analog method, (AM; Lorenz, 1969), according to the approach of the Model Output Statistics (MOS, Wilks, 2006). The simulations used as predictors have been the ERA40-driven RCMs provided by the EU-funded project ENSEMBLES. The Spain02 precipitation dataset (Herrera et al. 2010b) is used as predictand.<br \/>\nThe results show a big reduction of the systematic error of the RCMs in representing the spatial pattern of the climatology of several standard and extreme precipitation indices, maintaining or slightly improving the daily skill of the RCM. Besides, the AM shows a good representation of the annual cycle. These outcomes suggest the potential transferability of this method to other regions, the robustness of the method itself and the potentiality to calibrate also relatively low-performing model. Although generally good results are obtained testing the method in the wettest or driest years, considering the former, the AM added value is less evident. Consequently, the main limitation of the method, i.e. it cannot simulate unobserved weather patterns, should be cautiously considered in the application for future scenarios of precipitation: this method will perform worse in a future climate that differs greatly from present climate.<\/p>"

For this purpose, we cross-validate the different techniques focusing on three different aspects: a) accuracy scores (correlation, RMSE, etc.), b) distributional similarity scores (KS statistic and PDF-score), and c) stationarity\/robustness under climate change conditions. In the latter case we consider anomalous cold\/warm periods of the observational record ––which serve as surrogates of possible climate alterations-- and test the performance of the methods, as compared to random periods. It is found that a near-perfect association between observed and downscaled series (e.g. in terms of the Pearson Correlation) may hide important shortcomings in terms of robustness and distributional similarity. We found that  this adverse effect can be alleviated including near-surface temperature (e.g. 2m temperature) information into the predictor field, instead of only relying on data of the free troposphere. Free tropospheric absolute humidity should not be used as predictor since it leads to non-robust results in any case. In order to determine whether or not near-surface temperature is a suitable predictor for climate change downscaling applications, we tested GCM outputs in control scenarios w.r.t. the reanalysis predictors used to train the statistical downscaling methods. Moreover, we analyze both the standard perfect prognosis approach (applied to GCM predictors and used in this field during the last two decades) and some recent MOS-like versions suitable to be applied to RCM data. Examples are provided using methods and data from the ENSEMBLES project.<\/p>"

Complex networks have been recently applied in this context using graphs built from pairwise correlations between the different stations (or grid boxes) forming the dataset. However, this analysis does not take into account the full dependence structure underlying the data, gien by all possible marginal and conditional dependencies among the stations, and does not allow a probabilistic analysis of the dataset. In this talk we introduce Bayesian networks as an alternative multivariate analysis and modeling data-driven technique which allows building a joint probability distribution of the stations including all relevant dependencies in the dataset. Bayesian networks is a sound machine learning technique using a graph to 1) encode the main dependencies among the variables and 2) to obtain a factorization of the joint probability distribution of the stations given by a reduced number of parameters. For a particular problem, the resulting graph provides a qualitative analysis of the spatial relationships in the dataset (alternative to complex network analysis), and the resulting model allows for a probabilistic analysis of the dataset.<\/p>\n<p>Bayesian networks have been widely applied in many fields, but their use in climate problems is hampered by the large number of variables (stations) involved in this field, since the complexity of the existing algorithms to learn from data the graphical structure grows nonlinearly with the number of variables. In this contribution we present a modified local learning algorithm for Bayesian networks adapted to this problem, which allows inferring the graphical structure for thousands of stations (from observations) and\/or gridboxes (from model simulations) thus providing new possibilities for the multivariate analysis of these spatial datasets. An example for multi-site downscaling relating both model simulations and observations is used to illustrate the potential applications of Bayesian networks in climate applications.<\/p>"

            "drupal_node_body" : "<p>The  term  “wave  climate”  usually  refers  to  the  statistical  distribution  of  several oceanographical geophysical variables. Components of  the wave  climate are variables such as wind velocity, W, wind direction, θW, significant wave height, Hs, peak period, Tp,  and  mean  wave  direction,  θ.  Usually,  the  classical  analysis  of  the  long-term distribution  of  wave  climate  is  addressed  using  just  one  variable  (f.i.,  long-term distribution  of  significant  wave  height)  or  at  most  bidimensionally  (f.i.,  the bidimensional distribution of Hs and Tp). It is clear that the joint probability distribution of these five variables (Hs, Tp, θ, W, θW) is not easy to able to cope with. However, this problem  is  solved  applying  a  non-linear  clustering  algorithm,  namely  the  Self Organizing Maps  (SOM),  a  neural  network  technique  capable  of  classifying  the  high dimensional input reanalysis data in a low number of centroids (clusters) in an ordered sheet shape representation (Camus et al, 2007). The neurons are connected  to adjacent elements  by  a  neighbourhood  relation. A multidimensional  histogram  of  the  sea  state parameters is obtained allowing an easy further treatment of the classified sea states.  <\/p>\n<p>Figure  1  shows  a  23x23  SOM  applied  to  a  particular  site  located  in Villano, Galicia (Spain). In this case, the original data space has been projected into a toroid lattice being the data  accommodated  in  a  circular way. This  toroid  shape has been  again projected into  the  plane  for  a  better  visualization,  separating  the  centroids  which  are  located together, the centroids located in the upper side of the sheet are joined with the centroids<br \/>\nlocated on  the  lower  side of  the  sheet and with  the  lateral  sides  in  the 3D-dimension. Each cell of  the SOM  represents a cluster defined by  the  five parameters employed  in the classification. The significant wave height,  the wave period and  the wave direction are represented by the size, the colour intensity and the direction of the arrow; the pink arrow represents the wind vector. The background of each hexagon has been filled in a blue scale, function of the frequency of occurrence. As it can be seen in the figure, this classification  technique  is  capable  of  extracting  all  the  possible  sea  states  and  the transition between  them. The magnitudes of  the parameters which define  the centroids vary smoothly from one cell to another. The most energetic sea states present W-WNW<br \/>\ndirections  (i=17,  j=14).  The  higher  amount  of  data  is  grouped  in  clusters  with  low energy sea states (i=6, j=11). <\/p>\n<p>Figure 2 shows several SOMs for different locations along the northern coast of Spain. In this case, we are considering (Hs, Tp, θ)   and a 10x10 SOM. In the presentation, the theoretical  basis  and  some  examples  will  show  the  ability  of  this  methodology  to describe the multidimensional wave climate.<\/p>"

            "drupal_node_body" : "<p>In the context of the EGEE Earth Science Cluster Community there are several research efforts addressing data management issues at several levels and in different geosciences domains. One of them is Climate-G, that is a research effort devoted to the Climate Change community. It is a distributed testbed for climate change addressing challenging data and metadata management issues at a very large scale. The testbed is an interdisciplinary effort joining expertise in the field of climate change and computational science. The main goal of Climate-G is to allow scientists carrying out geographical and cross-institutional data discovery, access, visualization and sharing of climate data.<br \/>\nThe involved partners are: Centro Euro-Mediterraneo per i Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC, Italy), Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (IPSL\/CNRS, France), Fraunhofer Institut für Algorithmen und Wissenschaftliches Rechnen (SCAI, Germany), National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR, USA) and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI, USA), University of Reading (Reading, UK), University of Cantabria (UC, Spain), and University of Salento (UniSalento, Italy).<br \/>\nIn the first phase we addressed two main challenges, starting from our user requirements: (i) distributed data\/metadata management (hundreds of Petabytes of climate datasets) and (ii) scientific gateway (Climate-G Portal). The architectural design as well as the infrastructural implementation must provide the right answers to the two challenges. <\/p>\n<p>Data and Metadata Distribution<br \/>\nA key point for Climate-G is the full data and metadata distribution.<br \/>\nData distribution comes from the need of sharing data among centres without moving it in a central repository. Each partner can contribute with new datasets to the testbed just adding a new data service into the infrastructure and mapping it on a specific metadata server. The distributed approach clearly addresses scalability, performance and autonomy.<br \/>\nOn the other hand, metadata distribution comes from the need of addressing local autonomy (in terms of access policy and rights granted to the users), scalability (the whole set of metadata is split across several metadata services), fault tolerance (a central metadata service can result in a single point of failure) and performance (a central point to store data and metadata can result in a performance bottleneck for the whole system). It is worth noting here that metadata management plays a critical role in such a distributed environment, since it (i) enables search and discovery activities, (ii) allows describing and cataloguing datasets, (iii) makes data effectively accessible and shareable by the scientific community.<\/p>\n<p>Climate-G Infrastructure<br \/>\nClimate-G exploits both grid technologies connected with the EGEE project (gLite middleware and EGEE RESPECT tools) and domain-based tools and services (i.e. OPeNDAP and OGC compliant implementations). The former (general purpose services) provide a solid basis at an infrastructural level ensuring great flexibility, scalability and manageability (this has been proven in several testbed, projects and production-based environments such as EGEE); the latter provide support for domain specific activities (i.e. subsetting of data, map retrieving), are well known, well tested and widely adopted in the climate change community. The coexistence of grid and domain-related services is an important point to satisfy user requirements on a robust and mature infrastructure.<br \/>\nData virtualization is a key point to build a transparent environment for the climate community and it is strongly connected with: metadata and data management.<br \/>\nGoing into detail, concerning the metadata management, we adotped a distributed CMCC metadata solution (leveraging P2P and grid technologies) named GRelC. This service (included into the EGEE RESPECT Program) enables geographical data sharing, search and discovery and it is able to manage metadata information held in heterogeneous grid data sources. It exposes a GSI and VOMS enabled interface providing full security support (in terms of authentication, authorization, data integrity, data confidentiality and delegation). In the Climate-G testbed, metadata are stored both in relational databases (Index-DB) and XML ones (Metadata-DB) and are all available through the same grid-enabled GRelC interface. While the Index-DBs contain just key information, the Metadata-DBs contain full metadata descriptions stored into XML files. Harvesting of metadata is performed through the GRelC Harvester component built on top of the GRelC SDK. Additional details about the GRelC Harvester are out of the scope of this work. Presently, the metadata schema managed by the GRelC metadata services is compliant with ISO 19115\/19139 Standards.<br \/>\nThe GRelC metadata services (see Fig. 1) are P2P connected in a self-monitored and self-controlled network. Monitoring facilities are also available in the Climate-G Portal (see Fig. 2) giving the administrators full control of the underlying metadata system with real time monitoring capabilities, reports and statistics about the involved resources.<\/p>"

One of the main goals of this project is analyzing the impact of models and boundary conditions in the short-range high-resolution forecasted precipitation. A previous validation of this method has been done considering a set of climate networks in Spain, France and Germany, by interpolating the prediction to the gauge locations (SREPS, 2008). In this work we compare these results with those obtained by using a statistical downscaling method to post-process the global predictions, obtaining an \"advanced interpolation\" for the local precipitation using climate network precipitation observations. In particular, we apply the PROMETEO downscaling system based on analogs and compare the SREPS ensemble of 20 members with the PROMETEO statistical ensemble of 5 (analog ensemble) x 4 (GCMs) = 20 members. Moreover, we will also compare the performance of a combined approach post-processing the SREPS outputs using the PROMETEO system.<\/p>"

Nowadays, long-term time series of these parameters are available from reanalysis databases obtained by numerical models. The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) technique is applied to characterize multi-dimensional wave climate, obtaining the relevant “wave types” spanning the historical variability. This technique summarizes multi-dimension of wave climate in terms of a set of clusters projected in low-dimensional lattice with a spatial organization, providing Probability Density Functions (PDFs) on the lattice. On the other hand, wind and storm surge depend on instantaneous local large-scale sea level pressure (SLP) fields while waves depend on the recent history of these fields (say, 1 to 5 days). Thus, these variables are associated with large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns. <\/p>\n<p>In this work, a nearest-neighbors analog method is used to predict monthly multi-dimensional wave climate. This method establishes relationships between the large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns from numerical models (SLP fields as predictors) with local wave databases of observations (monthly wave climate SOM PDFs as predictand) to set up statistical models. A wave reanalysis database, developed by Puertos del Estado (Ministerio de Fomento), is considered as historical time series of local variables. The simultaneous SLP fields calculated by NCEP atmospheric reanalysis are used as predictors. Several applications with different size of sea level pressure grid and with different temporal domain resolution are compared to obtain the optimal statistical model that better represents the monthly wave climate at a particular site.<\/p>\n<p>In this work we examine the potential skill of this downscaling approach considering perfect-model conditions, but we will also analize the suitability of this methodology to be used for seasonal forecast and for long-term climate change scenario projection of wave climate.<\/p>"

            "drupal_node_body" : "<p>Several application areas as high energy physics or bio-applications have benefited for years from GRID technologies. Applications from the Earth Science community are starting to take advantage of this technology (see e.g. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eu-degree.eu\" title=\"www.eu-degree.eu\">www.eu-degree.eu<\/a>) . Earth science applications and, in particular, a climate and meteorological models poses a great challenge to the GRID in terms of the computing and storage requirements. These models are resolved by numerical equations that are CPU intensive applications which usually require long walltimes and produce large amounts of data.<\/p>\n<p>WRF for GRID (WRF4G) is a port of the WRF Modeling System to GRID environments. Small modifications to the source code of the model allow the monitoring and output data management in a flexible way. In addition to the model, the WRF Grid Enabling Layer (WRFGEL) is an interface between the model and the GRID, allowing the model to inform about its status, get the required input data and save the output data to a Storage Element (SE) in the GRID. Finally, a set of user scripts permits a flexible design of experiments consisting of realizations which can span different physics\/parameters and\/or a sequence of independent hindcasts.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, the heterogenous GRID infrastructure is subject to common failures and intermittent availability of resources the numerical weather models are not prepared for. For those reasons, in this contribution we present a new execution framework providing a software wrapper for a numerical prediction model. Since multi-site parallelism cannot be used due to latency, the GRID is best suited for large amounts of independent and relatively short simulations (ensembles). WRF4G is able to benefit from intrasite parallelism where available, though.<\/p>\n<p>The WRF4G framework has been adapted for the gLite middleware developed in the EGEE project (<a href=\"http:\/\/eu-egee.org\" title=\"http:\/\/eu-egee.org\">http:\/\/eu-egee.org<\/a>), and used in EELA2 project .<\/p>"

However, the use of GRID infrastructures is not yet a common practice in climate research, and only a few teams and applications in this area take advantage of them. Thus, the main objective of the WRF4G Project is to popularize the use of this technology in the atmospheric sciences area.<br \/>\nIn order to achieve this objective, a widely used application has been considered: the Weather Research &amp; Forecasting (WRF) model. For an easy experiment management,  a generic execution framework (WRF for GRID, WRF4G)  has been designed. WRF4G is a first generic approach to make the WRF model usable for scientific research purposes on the GRID.<br \/>\nGRID infrastructures have some limitations for executing applications that make an intensive use of CPU and memory for a long period of time. This makes necessary to develop a specific framework (middleware) which encapsulates the application and provides appropriate services to monitor and manage the execution and data workflows. The use of this framework is transparent and avoids the main problems posed by GRID infrastructures. Moreover, it simplifies the access to the these infrastructures and releases the research teams from the technical and computational aspects of the use of GRID.<br \/>\nThe WRF model research community uses the model in a wide spectrum of use-cases. WRF4G has been designed in a generic way in order to deal with a large variety of experiments and model configurations. Some of these experiments are: regional climate modeling, re-forecast experiments, sensitivity studies, ensemble simulations. The abstract design of the framework allows for a transparent and easy execution of any of these experiments. Thanks to its monitoring system, researchers can view the status and manage their experiments.<br \/>\nWRF4Gis currently being used for scientific production in our research team. As WRF4G supports both Grid infrastructures and local environments (clusters or single computers), our research team can benefit from all the resources available at a given time. At the moment, the team is using a PBS cluster and 3 different Grid infrastructures based on gLite (ES-NGI, ESR VO in EGI and GISELA). WRF4G is been promote and disseminate into the research community through projects like GISELA, CHAIN and EuAsiaGrid to the aim to make a tool tailored to the user. Thus, we can ensure a tested environment and a proper design and usability of the framework. As an open source initiative, the WRF4G framework could be included in the official WRF release in order to keep the framework up to date with the latest model releases<\/p>"

For this purpose, the portal includes data (common predictors such as SLP or Q850) from the ENSEMBLES project (global outputs from the Stream1 and 2 GCM simulations) and a number of popular statistical downscaling techniques (regression, GLMs, analogs, weather types, etc.), and allows performing downscaling using public observation datasets (GHCN, GSOD, etc.) and\/or private observed data. Moreover, the portal is based on WEB and GRID technologies, allowing scalability though the transparent use of distributed resources.<br \/>\nA complete reimplementation of the portal (version 2) has been performed in 2011 to allow the development of new functionalities demanded by the supporting projects (METAFOR, FUME, QWeCI, MOSAICC, etc.): Metadata management, calibration of regional climate models, on-demand output formats, etc. Most of these functionalities will be also open to the public in the near future due to the public character of the supporting projects. For instance, we are working to include in the portal is the metadata query services developed within the METAFOR project, so users can query and search global simulation from CMIP5. Moreover the portal can now be embedded in a more general framework, in combination\/cascade with other applications, using different style sheets to adapt to the required visualization style. For instance, the downscaling portal is part of the MOSAICC (MOdelling System for Agricultural Impacts of Climate Change, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fao.org\/climatechange\/mosaicc\" title=\"http:\/\/www.fao.org\/climatechange\/mosaicc\">http:\/\/www.fao.org\/climatechange\/mosaicc<\/a>) tool, developed by FAO to carry out each step of the impact assessment from climate scenarios downscaling to economic impact analysis at national level. In this case, the downscaling portal has been embedded in a common framework with a hydrological model (for estimating water resources for irrigation), a crop growth model (to simulate future crop yields) and finally a CGE (Computable General Equilibrium) model to assess the effect of changing yields on national economies.<\/p>\n<p>In this presentation we describe the new functionalities and possibilities of the ENSEMBLES downscaling portal, which can now be easily adapted to new projects\/institutions for particular requirements.<\/p>"

In this work, we present the successful port of an atmospheric Global Climate Model to the GRID by using existing middleware solutions plus newly developed tools (Grid Enabling Layer and Workflow Management Layer) to account for specific requirements posed by this application. In doing so, several weaknesses of current middleware were identified.<\/p>\n<p>Analysis:<\/p>\n<p>Climate models are complicated computer programs which require large amounts of CPU power. Most of them are parallelized. However, the GRID cannot make the most of this kind of parallelism. Apart from computer parallelism, climate science is recently making use of a large number of simulations, referred to as “ensemble”. Ensemble prediction is based on the generation of multiple simulations from perturbed model conditions to sample the existing uncertainties. In this work, we present a GRID application consisting of a state-of-the-art climate model (CAM). The main goal of the application is providing a user-friendly platform to run ensemble-based predictions on the GRID. This requires managing a complex workflow involving long-term jobs and data management in a user-transparent way. In doing so, we identified the weaknesses of current GRID middleware tools and developed a robust workflow by merging the optimal existing applications with an underlying self-developed workflow<\/p>\n<p>Impact:<\/p>\n<p>Although we have shown that current GRID technology is immature and not completely well suited for the Earth Science community, there are some fields in earth science, including recent trends in ensemble forecasting or any other involving independent simulations, which could greatly benefit from the grid.<br \/>\nRegarding the computational part, this work shows how a complex application can be succesfully ported to grid if a good workflow management is used. This could encourage users of some other disciplines to migrate their applications to grid.<\/p>\n<p>Conclusions:<\/p>\n<p>The port of the CAM model has given us the opportunity of running it on grid in a user-friendly way, hidden to the users the complexity of the grid . Although the effort of developing an application in GRID is very high, the results are worth. The next step in our work is porting the regional WRF model to the GRID and create a new application combining CAM and WRF.<\/p>"

            "drupal_node_body" : "<p>Several application areas as high energy physics or bio-applications have benefited for years from Grid technologies. Applications from the Earth Science community are starting to take advantage of this technology (see e.g. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eu-degree.eu\" title=\"www.eu-degree.eu\">www.eu-degree.eu<\/a>) . Earth science applications and, in particular, a climate and meteorological models poses a great challenge to the Grid in terms of the computing and storage requirements. These models are resolved by numerical equations that are CPU intensive applications which usually require long walltimes and produce large amounts of data.<br \/>\nIn this work we present the port to Grid environments of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.wrf-model.org\" title=\"http:\/\/www.wrf-model.org\">http:\/\/www.wrf-model.org<\/a>, [1]. This model is a state-of-the-art mesoscale numerical weather prediction system designed to serve both operational forecasting and atmospheric research needs. It has a rapidly growing community of users all around the world.<br \/>\nIn a previous work, within the EELA project, we ported the Community Atmospheric Model atmospheric model (CAM, [2]) to the Grid, developing a workflow to solve the most common problems encountered in the Grid [6]. The limited area models (another family of numerical atmospheric models) pose an additional challenge for the Grid, since not only the output data is large, but also the input data required before the simulation starts can be quite large. These models can be nested into global atmospheric models, thus, they are the natural step forward after the Gridification of the CAM model. The Gridification of a limited area model can give rise to a cascade of simulations running first a global model and, then, nesting one (or several) limited area simulations.<br \/>\n WRF for Grid (WRF4G) is a port of the WRF Modelling System to Grid environments. Small modifications to the source code of the model allow the monitoring and output data management in a flexible way. In addition to the model, the WRF Grid Enabling Layer (WRFGEL) is an interface between the model and the Grid, allowing the model to inform about its status, get the required input data and save the output data to a Storage Element (SE) in the Grid. Finally, a set of user scripts permits a flexible design of experiments consisting of realizations which can span different physics\/parameters and\/or a sequence of independent hindcasts.<br \/>\nCurrently, the heterogeneous Grid infrastructure is subject to common failures and intermittent availability of resources the numerical weather models are not prepared for. For those reasons, in this contribution we present a new execution framework providing a software wrapper for a numerical prediction model. Since multi-site parallelism cannot be used due to latency, the Grid is best suited for large amounts of independent and relatively<br \/>\nshort simulations (ensembles). WRF4G is able to benefit from intrasite parallelism where available, though.<br \/>\nAs an illustrative example, the EELA-2[4] infrastructure can be used to perform an ensemble of seasonal prediction simulations by nesting the global predictions over key regions such as El Niño sensitive areas over Latin-America. Taking advantage of the Grid, all members of the global ensemble could be nested and each could be perturbed in the physics to obtain a larger ensemble and a better estimation of the uncertainty.<\/p>"

Extreme precipitation indices were computed from daily gridded dataset derived through interpolation of station data (E-OBS) version 3.0 for the period 1950-2009. In this study, we will show results for consecutive wet days index (CWD) and highest one day precipitation amount per time period (RX1DAY). The differences between the trends in the north, center and south of Europe in winter, spring, summer and autumn are analyzed. The variability of the indices is characterized by means of Empirical Orthogonal Function to regionalize the extreme indices. We used statistical regression to obtain the influence of teleconnections on precipitation extremes. These results will be compared against to mean precipitation (RR). It was found greater influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Scandinavian teleconnection pattern (SCA) on extreme precipitation than on mean precipitation. We also present composite maps of geopotential and wind anomalies to show favourable conditions in atmospheric circulation for the occurrence of extreme events. These findings could be applied to achieve forecast of local extremes.<\/p>"

In this study, particular attention is given to the predictability during strong El Niño and La Niña events. The teleconnection between precipitation and temperature variability in Europe and the ENSO events is analysed season by season using the dataset from the Joint Research Center with 50km ofresolution (JRC, <a href=\"http:\/\/agrifish.jrc.it\/marsstat\/\" title=\"http:\/\/agrifish.jrc.it\/marsstat\/\">http:\/\/agrifish.jrc.it\/marsstat\/<\/a>). The connections are evaluated in terms of order statistics (terciles and quintiles) taking into account the strongest La Niña and El Niño events for the period 1975-2000. The frequency of, e.g., dry and wet terciles during El Niño (and La Niña) events are compared against climatology (uniform frequency of the terciles), obtaining the statistical significance of the observed anomalies. A particular study is developed over Spain using a higher resolution gridded dataset (20 km) which has been produced from the raw data of the Spanish INM pluviometric network (about 3000 stations).<br \/>\nAccording to these results, seasonal predictions are validated in different parts of Europe where a significant teleconnection signal was found. To this aim we used a combination of a multimodel ensemble system (DEMETER project) plus a statistical downscaling method. Nowadays, the most important meteorological institutions around the world have developed coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models which allow to predict climate anomalies at interannual time scales, such as El Niño phenomenon, several months in advance. Although certain predictability exists over the tropical Pacific at interannual time scale, there are some limitations at higher latitudes far from the influence of tropical Pacific. Therefore, the models should be validated to provide end-users with accurate information about the value of the seasonal predictions at extra-tropical latitudes.<br \/>\nThe goal of the study is twofold: The validation of seasonal forecasts from the DEMETER project at middle latitudes, and the need to provide local information in order to improve seasonal forecasts. Statistical donwscaling methods translate large-scale information to local or regional scale by means of empirical relationships between large-scale variables and the target local variables. The statistical downscaling method considered in this study is based on the search of analogs (Gutierrez et al 2004). The method differs from the standard analog approach by applying a clustering technique to the predictors. It allows the definition of meaningful subgroups (weather types) each associated with a reference pattern which represents a specific atmospheric scenario. This approach is applied to assess the DEMETER skill to forecast seasonal precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature over Europe taking into account the observed influence of ENSO events. Seasonal ensemble forecasts from the direct output from DEMETER and the downscaled values are verified against observations from a probabilistic point of view taking into account order statistics (terciles and quintiles). Some cases studies are reported in this work.<\/p>"

In recent years there has been an increasing demand for comprehensive regular high-resolution (both in time and space) gridded datasets from different sectors, including hydrology, agriculture and health which are severely affected by extreme events. One of the main shortcomings of gridded datasets is that extreme events can be smoothed during the interpolation process. Heavy rainfall events can be very local and, hence, interpolation with neighboring stations may lead to an underestimation of the precipitation amounts.<br \/>\nIn this work we study the capability of a high-resolution daily precipitation gridded dataset over Spain (we refer to this dataset as Spain02, Herrera et al 2010) to characterize extreme precipitation. A dense network of 2756 quality-controlled stations was selected to develop the Spain02 grid with a regular 0.2º horizontal resolution covering the period from 1950 to 2003. We study both upper percentiles and the extreme indicators commonly used to characterize extreme precipitation regimes. We also show the performance of the gridded dataset to capture both the intensity and the spatial structure of severe precipitation episodes which constitute characteristic ephemerides of extreme weather in the Iberian peninsula. The results are compared to the 25 Km E-OBS grid (Haylock et al 2008) developed in the ENSEMBLES project, which is the best daily dataset for the whole Europe to date.<\/p>"

El aumento de los valores característicos para un periodo de retorno de 40 años (que duplica el correspondiente a los valores medios en algunas zonas) indica un mayor impacto del cambio climático en los eventos extremos,  como también se ha mostrado en otros estudios. Además los resultados obtenidos considerando diferentes periodos de retorno (40 o 100 años) son muy parecidos, siendo estas diferencias más pequeñas que las producidas por la señal de cambio climático mencionada antes.<\/p>"

The last few decades though, the number of forest fires has significantly increased, as<br \/>\nwell as their severity and impact on the environment. Local fire danger projections are often required when dealing<br \/>\nwith wild fire research. In the present study the application of statistical downscaling and spatial interpolation<br \/>\nmethods was performed to the Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI), in order to assess forest fire risk in Greece.<br \/>\nThe FWI is used worldwide (including the Mediterranean basin) to estimate the fire danger in a generalized fuel<br \/>\ntype, based solely on weather observations. The meteorological inputs to the FWI System are noon values of<br \/>\ndry-bulb temperature, air relative humidity, 10m wind speed and precipitation during the previous 24 hours.<br \/>\nThe statistical downscaling methods are based on a statistical model that takes into account empirical relationships<br \/>\nbetween large scale variables (used as predictors) and local scale variables. In the framework<br \/>\nof the current study the statistical downscaling portal developed by the Santander Meteorology Group<br \/>\n(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.meteo.unican.es\/downscaling\" title=\"https:\/\/www.meteo.unican.es\/downscaling\">https:\/\/www.meteo.unican.es\/downscaling<\/a>) in the framework of the EU project CLIMRUN (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.climrun.eu\" title=\"www.climrun.eu\">www.climrun.eu<\/a>)<br \/>\nwas used to downscale non standard parameters related to forest fire risk.<br \/>\nIn this study, two different approaches were adopted. Firstly, the analogue downscaling technique was directly<br \/>\nperformed to the FWI index values and secondly the same downscaling technique was performed indirectly through<br \/>\nthe meteorological inputs of the index. In both cases, the statistical downscaling portal was used considering the<br \/>\nERA-Interim reanalysis as predictands due to the lack of observations at noon.<br \/>\nAdditionally, a three-dimensional (3D) interpolation method of position and elevation, based on Thin Plate Splines<br \/>\n(TPS) was used, to interpolate the ERA-Interim data used to calculate the index. Results from this method were<br \/>\ncompared with the statistical downscaling results obtained from the portal.<br \/>\nFinally, FWI was computed using weather observations obtained from the Hellenic National Meteorological Service,<br \/>\nmainly in the south continental part of Greece and a comparison with the previous results was performed.<\/p>"

We analyze a co-evaluation experience as part of the evaluation of the subject of Statistics in the Chemical Engineering degree of the University of Cantabria. For this purpose, we used the Moodle learning platform. Co-evaluation was put into practice by applying anonymous peer reviews to group projects. The study shows the need to stipulate as clearly as possible the common evaluation criteria to avoid discrepancies in the evaluation. We also highlight the positive aspect of involving the students in the evaluation process, allowing them to improve their own learning process from a different point of view to the traditional learning methodologies. It is also important to stress the important role of new technologies which allow us to develop these methodologies in an interactive and transparent way for students. The use of Moodle increases students’ interest and makes this method of evaluation more attractive to them.<\/p>"

The current global databases of seasonal forecasting allow the identification of seasonal climate anomalies for the next months (usually, between 3 and 9 months), which influence the surface water balance in any watershed. However, a feasible and robust tool is needed to connect this available information with the hydrology of the watershed and water quality in downstream freshwater systems. Here we present such a tool following a work-flow from seasonal forecasting information, hydrologic modeling and lake modeling. We applied this methodology in Sau Reservoir (Spain) associated with the Ter River (1400 km2), as a practical example, yet the tool is designed to be applied in any system, using as forcing two seasonal forecasting databases: CFSv2 (from NCEP) and System4 (from ECMWF). The seasonal forecasting data were corrected and visualized using the climate4R packages, which was used as meteorological input in the hydrologic model. We used the hydrologic model (mHMv5.9) to obtain streamflow, which was used as input in the lake model (GOTM). Finally, the lake model is forced by the streamflow and seasonal forecasting data. Due to the lack of predictability in Europe, consistency among the forecasting systems used was not found. The outputs and analysis from this methodology are useful to identify the most pressing needs to develop usable seasonal water quality predictions.<\/p>"

We first simulate the observed trends using the connection of daily snow occurrence with large-scale fields simulated by a GCM; for this purpose we apply an analog-based statistical downscaling method working in perfect prognosis conditions using reanalysis data. The annual frequency obtained by adding the simulated daily snow occurrences reproduces very well both the observed trends and the high interannual variability. In the second part of the work, we investigate the capabilities of this technique to simulate future trends in a climate change scenario. For such a purpose, we analyze the problem under non-stationary climate conditions, using the 10 coldest consecutive years as training period to simulate the snow frequency in warmer conditions (the remaining period).

A previous quality analysis has been performed based only on the length of missing periods and the stations with less than 10% of missing data in the period 1957-2002 were selected for the study. In the first part of the work a trend analysis is performed regarding the annual number of days in which snow occurred, obtaining a significant decreasing trend in the last 15 years. <\/p>\n<p>Secondly, the connection of snow with large-scale fields simulated by a General Circulation Model (GCM) is analyzed using statistical downscaling methods (in particular analog and weather typing techniques). On the one hand, we validate the probabilistic predictions using Relative Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves. However, due to the low climatological annual frequency of snow occurrence (around 6% in average), appropriate thresholds for the predicted probability have been calculated for each station to obtain deterministic predictions which can be validated with 2x2 contingency tables (for instance, typical values for HIR are around 60% whereas FARs are around 2%). Using this technique the annual number of days with snow is correctly simulated for the different stations, reproducing the observed trends. These results are based on cross-validation studies, in which a window around each of the predicted dates is removed in the analysis. <\/p>\n<p>In order to check the possible extrapolation of statistical downscaling to climate change studies, the following experiment was conducted: the last 15 years of data –in which the decreasing trend was observed- were tried to simulate using the remaining 30 years as the training period to develop the statistical model. Some promising results are reported.<\/p>"

Nowadays, LAM’s resolution is growing so fast, providing better predictions over smaller scale phenomena, but at the same time, this growth is even faster in the observation networks, increasing the resolution gap between LAM’s and observations. This situation seems to be a very good opportunity for the statistical approaches, but they aren’t able to avoid over-fitting, due to the high dimensionality of the resulting models, on the one hand, and due to the short length of the newest available historical records, on the other. In this work, we present a new way to take advantage of the higher resolution of the different observation networks, using a Bayesian Network (BN) based model. This is possible because BN’s are suitable to joint different observation nets in the same model, using a small number of parameters to prevent overfitting; first, considering binary predictands and then,  connecting the newest to the oldest ones in a hierarchical way. The resulting model has shown to be skilful with respect to the Naïve Analogue method.<\/p>"

Generative Classifiers are a special kind of Bayesian Networks in which there exist two different types of nodes: the classifier node, and the rest, which are the attributes. In this work different generative classifiers have been used to develop a probabilistic model for the simulation of high resolution spatially distributed weather sequences for binary events. The main difference between discriminative and generative classifiers is that discriminative classifiers (Analogues, Weather Typing, SOM or SVM) directly model the posterior, and generative classifiers first model the joint distribution to get the posterior, taking into account the relationships among the different attributes given some kind of available evidence. Generative Classifiers provide us a simple method for generating stochastic weather in a spatially consistent manner. Instead of simulating values independently for each variable (as in standard weather generator methods) we simulate spatial realizations taking into account the constraints imposed by the dependencies in a graph. For the sake of simplicity, we illustrate the application of simulation algorithms in the case of discrete variables (precipitation), though a similar scheme is applicable to the continuous case.<\/p>\n<p>The study has been carried out over a small area with 42 locations in the north Atlantic face of the Iberian Peninsula, and the precipitation variable based on extreme and normal events was used. The quality measurement is based on the Relative Operating Characteristics (ROC) area. ROC is used to evaluate the different classifiers: naive, augmented and generic, for the three meteorological paradigms: forecasting, nowcasting and climatic. Finally we have shown that the spatial dependencies are useless in the case of pure forecasting, that is, given an estimation of the atmospheric state (i.e. numerical weather prediction). However, these dependencies become very important in the nowcasting and climatic paradigms, that is, when some kind of evidence, other than the atmospheric state, is considered.<\/p>"

Downscaling techniques allow adapting those forecasts to a regional scale, but a lower skill is expected for the resulting regional predictions. In this paper we use the reanalysis data provided by the multi-model ensemble project DEMETER to validate the skill of seasonal regional forecasts in different regions of Perú. This project provides forecasts from 1949 to 1999 for six European global coupled atmosphere-ocean models with different perturbation schemes (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ecmwf.int\/research\/demeter\/\" title=\"http:\/\/www.ecmwf.int\/research\/demeter\/\">http:\/\/www.ecmwf.int\/research\/demeter\/<\/a>). This reanalysis provides a convenient framework to validate seasonal forecasts for different El Niño episodes. The downscaling method used in this paper is an implementation of an analog-based clustering technique which allows to efficiently combining different ensemble forecasts from different models into a single probabilistic forecast with an estimation of the associated predictability (based on the  ispersion of the ensembles). As a result, we obtained skilful regional predictions for different El Niño episodes in two different areas of Perú: the coast (positive anomalies), and the central mountain range (negative anomalies).<\/p>"

Esta rejilla  se ha obtenido siguiendo un proceso similar al aplicado para la construcción de una rejilla sobre Europa en el proyecto ENSEMBLES (<a href=\"http:\/\/eca.knmi.nl\/download\/ensembles\/ensembles.php\" title=\"http:\/\/eca.knmi.nl\/download\/ensembles\/ensembles.php\">http:\/\/eca.knmi.nl\/download\/ensembles\/ensembles.php<\/a>). Para ello, se ha trabajado con la red secundaria de estaciones de AEMET, aplicando distintos filtros de calidad (longitud y cortes) y homogeneidad (absoluta y relativa) a las series disponibles, resultando más de 2000 estaciones para precipitación y unas 1000 estaciones para temperatura. Posteriormente se compararon distintas técnicas de interpolación (splines, angular distance weighting, kriging, núcleos gausianos), eligiendo la más apropiada en base a los resultados de una validación sobre un conjunto de 200 estaciones elegidas aleatoriamente. Este análisis concluyó que la técnica de kriging era la más conveniente (con resultados similares a angular distance weighting, pero con más base teórica y menos coste computacional). En este caso, dada la densidad de estaciones disponible, no fue necesario considerar la orografía como co-variable, evitando así la introducción de tendencias espurias. De esta manera se produjeron las rejillas diarias de precipitación y temperatura para el período 1960-2004; en el primero de los casos se aplicó previamente un algoritmo de kriging binario para determinar los días de ocurrencia de precipitación.<\/p>\n<p>En una segunda parte del trabajo se analizan distintas propiedades de las rejillas, comparándolas con otros productos existentes (en particular con la rejilla desarrollada en ENSEMBLES); se muestran resultados relativos a la reproducción de estadísticos centrales, de dispersión, y también indicadores de extremos (percentiles 95 y 99); se muestra que la rejilla SpainHR reproduce de forma precisa la variabilidad especial reflejada por las observaciones, así como también reproduce el patrón espacial de los percentiles considerados (que difiere significativamente del patrón promedio); estos patrones no pueden ser capturados por otros productos, como la rejilla de ENSEMBLES. También se muestra como la rejilla permite reproducir ciertas efemérides \"extremas\" significativas. Por tanto, la rejilla SpainHR permite analizar no sólo medias y variabilidad, sino también el comportamiento de algunos estadísticos indicadores de extremos (obsérvese que el tratamiento riguroso de extremos requeriría una metodología específica). Por último, también se analizan las tendencias de temperatura y precipitación en las últimas décadas, comparando los resultados de la rejilla con los resultados directos de observaciones. Finalmente, creemos que esta rejilla jugará un papel importante a la hora de validar los modelos regionales de clima en tiempo presente, ya que su resolución se adecua a la de estos modelos.<\/p>"

The average regime comparison is carried out by ensemble mean results and seasonality is studied by temporal evolution of the monthly anual cycle over 11 Spanish river basins. The extreme precipitation regime is analysed by the use of different extreme precipitation indicators. Results show a large variety of concordance of the members of the ensemble to the observed climatology.

The ensemble Prediction System (EPS) is the most used method to achieve this probabilistic forecast. The EPS consist on considering the evolution of an ensemble of prepared initial conditions with one or more models. Differences between the members of the  ensemble evolved with the same model and considered at the same time are, in general, finite fluctuations that reflect the amplification of small initial errors in chaotic models. The study of these fluctuations is important, not only to analyze the chaotic behavior of the system, which can be of academic interest, but also to prepare the optimal initial conditions of the ensemble, which has practical implications.<\/p>\n<p>In this work we consider the two-scale Lorenz’96 model to analyze the spatio-temporal dynamics of their fluctuations and to define the proper Liapunov vector basis to build the optimal initial conditions of the ensemble. It is shown that when the coupling between slow and fast variables is weak the slow variables dominate the evolution of fluctuations whereas in the case of strong coupling the fast variables impose a non-trivial complex error growth pattern on the slow variables with two different regimes, before and after saturation of fast variables. This complex behavior is analyzed using both a Liapunov-like approach and the recently introduced Mean-Variance Logarithmic (MVL) diagram.<\/p>\n<p>Another effect of the strong coupling is the enhancement of the wave behavior which was latent in the one-scale model. Now wave patterns interfere with chaotic fluctuations giving rise to unexpected phenomena that are important for the initial ensemble preparation: Liapunov vectors (LVs) exhibit a spatial localization highly correlated to the wavy pattern. When the vector basis is orthogonal (backward and forward LV’s) the localization site of each LV is determined by the selected metric instead of being determined by the true dynamics. This artificial disposition of the LVs (spurious effects of orthogonalization) can be avoided using the so-called characteristic LVs, an unambiguous basis that should be highly appreciated for assessing initial conditions in EPS.<\/p>"

Con esta información se obtuvo el Mapa de tipos o zonas agroclimáticas de Papadakis con resolución 1x1 km. Finalmente, se ha obtenido la evolución del Mapa Agroclimático a lo largo de cuatro períodos temporales 1971-2000, 2011-2040 y 2041-2070 y 2071-2100.

Moreover, two different approaches have been followed in order to guarantee areal-averaged or point representativity of the resulting grid values. For the former, the interpolation process has been carried out in two steps, following the approach used to build E-OBS: 1) the interpolation method has been applied at a 0.01º horizontal resolution and 2) the final grids have been obtained averaging the results into the final resolution. Furthermore, two alternative approaches are considered in all cases to test the sensitivity to the use of the orography as a covariable in the interpolation procedure.<\/p>\n<p>Besides of introducing the new set of gridded datasets, in this work we also present some preliminary results on the sensitivity of the mean and extreme regimes of precipitation to all these factors.

The methods are assessed not only in terms of accuracy and distributional similarity, but also considering their robustness\/stationarity in changing climate conditions; to this aim, anomalous historical periods (warm\/cold for maximum temperature and wet\/dry for precipitation) are used as surrogates of possible future climate alterations, and differences with normal periods are tested using a standard Student t-test.

In particular, we perform an extensive validation of this RCMs under optimal (using RCMs driven by ERA40) and sub-optimal conditions (using RCMs driven by GCM in current climate), considering the recent developed Spain02 observed dataset.

Such information generated by climate models has a number of uncertainties and one of them is ability of climate models to accurately simulate the complex climate system. All model are only an approximation of the real climate system and have different errors or biases resulting in deviation of the simulated climate from the observed once. Nowadays, it is widely recognised that climate model results, as an input to impact models, cannot be used directly and an adjustment (bias correction) towards the observed climatology is necessary. Applying bias adjustment to climate model simulations introduces a new, unexplored level of uncertainty in impact modelling and often the bias-adjusted simulations are blindly used even if their limitations are very well known.<\/p>\n<p>To fill such bias-adjustment-related gaps in use of climate information a Bias Correction Intercomparison Project (BCIP) has been recently established. The BCIP addresses following topics: i) to quantify what level of uncertainties bias adjustment introduces to workflow of climate information, ii) to advance bias-adjustment technique and iii) to provide the best practice on use of the bias-adjusted climate simulations. Within the BCIP two experiments focusing on different climate zones have been designed, namely: one on the mid-latitude climate taking the Euro-CORDEX simulations (50km) and the E-OBS data set as a reference and the second on the tropical climate using the CORDEX-Africa simulations (50km) and the WATCH ERA-Interim data set as a reference.<\/p>\n<p>Applying different bias-correction methods and different modifications of the same method to the same input data sets allows assessing impact of bias-correction technique on climate simulations. A number of various statistics describing climatology are taken for evaluation and analysis starting from basic seasonal means and ending, with a special emphasize, by high-order statistics as extreme events, variability and climate indices. We present a detail overview of the BCIP together with the first results.<\/p>"

Despite being physically based, RCMs include many non-observable parameters, which need to be adjusted to represent the observed climate as closely as possible. This tuning process is usually not well documented, but central statistics of well-observed variables, such as temperature or precipitation, have greatly reduced their bias in state-of-the-art RCMs as compared to earlier versions. The availability of new gridded observational products has also contributed to this advance.<\/p>\n<p>Extreme events in climate science follow essentially two approaches: (1) a pragmatic approach, based on sample high-order percentiles (e.g. 95 th percentile) and (2) a proper characterization of extremes, by fitting a theoretical model (GEV, POT) to data and considering measures such as return values or distribution parameters. The percentile approach has shown that, due to the nature of precipitation (reasonably fitted by a single-parameter exponential distribution), a bias correction of the mean also reduces biases in tail percentiles. In this work, we compared this result with a proper characterization of extremes, showing that the bias correction of central statistics also improves return values of precipitation. This has implications for the credibility of RCMs in an altered climate, when they have been tuned to fit the current observed climate.<\/p>"

A substantial amount of research has been carried out, in particular with respect to new TCI formulae adapted to specific tourism products and parameters and their weighting, taking into account surveys on the stated preferences of tourists, especially in terms of comfort. This paper illustrates another field of research that seeks to better understand the different sources of uncertainty associated with TCIs. Indeed, slight differences in formula thresholds, variations in computation methods, and also the use of multimodel ensembles create nuances that affect the ways in which TCI projections are usually presented. Firstly, we assess the impact of differences in preference surveys on the definition of TCI thresholds, in particular for thermal comfort. Secondly, we compare computation methods for France, showing the need to better specify detailed data sources and their use to ensure the comparability of results. Thirdly, using multimodel ensembles for the Mediterranean basin, we assess the uncertainty inherent in long-term projections, which are used in modelling the economic impact of climate change. This paper argues in favor of a more cautious use of tourism comfort indices, with more consideration given to the robustness of data (validation, debiasing, uncertainty assessment, etc.) and users’ needs, from the climate services perspective.<\/p>"

A key deliverable of VALUE is the development of a systematic validation framework to enable the assessment and comparison of downscaling methods. Such assessments can be expected to crucially depend on the existence of accurate and reliable observational reference data. In dynamical downscaling, observational data can influence model development itself and, later on, model evaluation, parameter calibration and added value assessment. In empirical-statistical downscaling, observations serve as predictand data and directly influence model calibration with corresponding effects on downscaled climate change projections.<\/p>\n<p>We here present a comprehensive assessment of the influence of uncertainties in observational reference data and of scale-related issues on several of the above-mentioned aspects. First, temperature and precipitation characteristics as simulated by a set of reanalysis-driven EURO-CORDEX RCM experiments are validated against three different gridded reference data products, namely (1) the EOBS dataset (2) the recently developed EURO4M-MESAN regional re-analysis, and (3) several national high-resolution and quality-controlled gridded datasets that recently became available. The analysis reveals a considerable influence of the choice of the reference data on the evaluation results, especially for precipitation. It is also illustrated how differences between the reference data sets influence the ranking of RCMs according to a comprehensive set of performance measures.<\/p>\n<p>Second, a large number of empirical-statistical downscaling methods is calibrated and validated against observational reference data reflecting conditions at different spatial scales: the point\/station scale and the aggregated spatial scale as represented by the gridded EOBS 0.22° dataset. Evaluation reveals a dependency of the calibrated model parameters on the choice of the reference data and, hence, a general scale dependency.<\/p>\n<p>In summary, the results obtained highlight the central role of observational reference data for the development, calibration and validation of climate downscaling methods. Their reflected spatial scales should closely match the respective target scale of the downscaling, and calibration and evaluation efforts should consider an ensemble of observational data sources in order to account for reference data uncertainty.<\/p>"

Some of them also simulate river routing and underground water processes. They may be run within a meteorological model (coupled to the atmosphere) or within a climate model (coupled to the atmosphere and the ocean). In addition, they are often used in non coupled mode (offline), forced by a gridded dataset of meteorological observations. This allows to use the models as physically based and distributed hydrological models, which are often applied to understand hydrological processes at large scales (national, continental or global). Some of the processes that can be studied with such models include: the evolution of the snowpack, evapotranspiration, runoff generation, the response of soil moisture and river flow.<\/p>\n<p>In order to run LSMs offline, it is necessary to use high quality, high resolution gridded datasets of meteorological variables, including precipitation, temperature, wind speed, relative humidity and downward visible and infrared radiation. Here we present a new meteorological forcing dataset for Spain (Quintana-Seguí et al., 2016a), which is based on the SAFRAN meteorological analysis system (Durand et. al.,1993,1999; Quintana-Seguí et al., 2008). This dataset, uses optimal interpolation in order to integrate a first guess (ERA-Interim) and observations (from AEMET's network) in order to produce the final grid. The resulting dataset, which has an spatial resolution of 5 km, a temporal resolution of 1 h and a length of 35 years, has been validated with observations. Furthermore, its precipitation has been compared, at the daily scale, to Spain02 (Herrera et al., 2012, 2015), another well known gridded dataset (Quintana-Seguí et al, 2016b).<\/p>\n<p>We also present the application of the SURFEX LSM (Masson et al, 2013) to Spain, at a resolution of 5 km. We discuss how it can be used to study relevant processes such as soil moisture (Escorihuela and Quintana-Seguí, 2016), drought and water resources at large scales. Furthermore, the EAUDYSEE1-RAPID river routing scheme is also presented (Cédric et al., 2011a, 2011b). We use it to transform SURFEX's water outflows (surface and subsurface runoff) to daily river flow using the Muskingum method. In its current form, the SAFRAN-SURFEX-RAPID model allows to simulate natural river flows in Spain (together with the aforementioned land-surface processes). In this study, the river flows are compared, at the monthly scale, to the flows produced by the SIMPA model (Álvarez et al., 2004), which is used by the Spanish Ministry of the Environment to simulate the main Spanish basins.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, we discuss the possible future orientations and applications of the SAFRAN-SURFEX-RAPID distributed hydrological modeling system.<\/p>\n<p>This work has been produced within the EU-FP7 project eartH2Observe and the Spanish MARCO project. eartH2Observe aims at integrating available global earth observations, in-situ datasets and models to conduct a global water resources re-analysis dataset of significant length. One of the case studies is set in Spain where the focus is on how the global EO products and local model results can contribute to drought prediction and management. We are focused on the reproduction of drought conditions and the role of groundwater in their dynamics. The Spanish project MARCO aims at improving how regional climate models (RCM) simulate hydrometeorological extremes. Offline LSM simulations are performed in order to detect areas of improvement and also as baseline for evaluating coupled RCM simulations.<\/p>"

For this purpose we employ three different gridded observational reference grids, namely (1) the well-established EOBS  dataset  (2)  the  recently  developed  EURO4M-MESAN  regional  re-analysis,  and  (3)  several  national high-resolution and quality-controlled gridded datasets that recently became available. In terms of climate models five reanalysis-driven experiments carried out by five different RCMs within the EURO-CORDEX framework are used. Two variables (temperature and precipitation) and a range of evaluation metrics that reflect different aspects of RCM performance are considered. We furthermore include an illustrative model ranking exercise and relate observational spread to RCM spread.<br \/>\nThe  results  obtained  indicate  a  varying  influence  of  observational  uncertainty  on  model  evaluation  depending on the variable, the season, the region and the specific performance metric considered. Over most parts of the  continent,  the  influence  of  the  choice  of  the  reference  dataset  for  temperature  is  rather  small  for  seasonal mean values and interannual variability. Here, model uncertainty (as measured by the spread between the five RCM simulations considered) is typically much larger than reference data uncertainty. For parameters of the daily temperature distribution and for the spatial pattern correlation, however, important dependencies on the reference dataset  can  arise.  The  related  evaluation  uncertainties  can  be  as  large  or  even  larger  than  model  uncertainty.<br \/>\nFor  precipitation  the  influence  of  observational  uncertainty  is,  in  general,  larger  than  for  temperature.  It  often dominates model uncertainty especially for the evaluation of the wet day frequency, the spatial correlation and the shape and location of the distribution of daily values. But even the evaluation of large-scale seasonal mean values can be considerably affected by the choice of the reference. When employing a simple and illustrative model rank-<br \/>\ning scheme on these results it is found that RCM ranking in many cases depends on the reference dataset employed.<\/p>"

This is why in this work the use of THREDDS Data Server (TDS) is been proposed as a proof of concept for that purpose. TDS is a web server that provides metadata and data access services for scientific datasets, using a variety of remote data access protocols [4]. TDS is implemented in 100% Java, and is contained in a web application archive (WAR) deployment file, which allows very easy installation into the open-source Apache Tomcat application server. TDS combines catalog services with integrated data-serving capabilities, including OPeNDAP, HTTP file serving, and OGC Web Coverage Server (WCS). Using TDS, it is possible to publish a dataset using catalog, OPeNDAP and HTTP services without having to duplicate any other information. Even though it is possible to use both sets of functionality separately, the integration of catalog services and data serving reduces the burden of server configuration and management.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of implementation, in this work a cluster of tomcat server instances is deployed as the backend and together with a load-balancing system based on Apache HTTP (httpd).

A single server that handles all the incoming requests may not have the capacity to handle high traffic volumes. Because of that, the processing load must be distributed among the cluster of servers. Server load balancing distributes service requests across a group of real servers and makes those servers look like a single large server to the clients. <\/p>\n<p>In this work, httpd works as an application-level load balancer, which means that uses a HTTP Request parameter decides which backend server to use.

Land-Use Land Cover (LULC) interfaces derived from ESA Climate Change Iniciative-Land Cover (CCI-LC) 2005 (covering 2003-2007 period at 300m resolution) were used as indirect indicator of socio-economic drivers associated with human-caused wildfire ignition sources. Three general interfaces were used; forest-agricultural interface (FAI), grassland-forest interface (GFI) and wildland urban interface (WUI), as well as other more specific ones derived from a disaggregated LULC legend. A set of biophysical variables including orientation, monthly precipitation, temperature (mean, minimum and maximum) as well as live fuel moisture content (FMC) were also considered in the model. Monthly precipitation and temperature were obtained from a regional climate dataset developed for the study sites by the University of Cantabria (Spain) at 1km2 spatial resolution while FMC were calculated from MODIS images following Yebra et al. (2008) methodology. Orientation was obtained from the Digital Terrain Model at 25m available for Spain at the Spanish National Geographic Institute (CNIG).<\/p>\n<p>Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) were used to obtain four sub-models to estimate wildfire occurrence in the two study regions during the 2000-2010 period. Two models included only LULC interfaces at two different disaggregation levels, and the other two models also included biophysical drivers. Results showed that disaggregated interfaces helped to improve the spatial characterization of probability of occurrence. FAI was the LULC general interface that contributed the most to the models. Biophysical drivers had larger contribution to the models than the interfaces but the later still had importance explaining the spatial distribution of the fire occurrence probability. The accuracy of the models improved when biophysical variables were included achieving a sensitivity of~42% and omission errors of ~58% in Zamora and ~6% and 90%, respectively in Madrid. The results for Madrid were less accurate mainly due to the small number of fire events to fit the models. Future works will deal with modelling in areas with small but of importance number of fires as in this last site. This study indicates that the human component of wildfires represented by LULC interfaces and its disaggregation can be integrated into wildfire occurrence estimation.<\/p>"

For instance, the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) constitutes a framework for consistently projecting the impacts of climate change across affected sectors and spatial scales. These data are very attractive for any impact application since they offer worldwide bias-corrected data based on Global Climate Models (GCMs). Complementary, the CORDEX initiative has incorporated experiments based on regionally-downscaled bias-corrected data by means of debiasing and quantile mapping (QM) methods. In light of this situation, it is challenging to distill the most accurate and useful information for climate services, but at the same time it creates a perfect framework for intercomparison and sensitivity analyses.<\/p>\n<p>In the present study, the trend-preserving ISIMIP method and empirical QM are applied to climate model simulations that were carried out at different spatial resolutions (CMIP5 GCMs and EURO-CORDEX Regional Climate Models (RCMs), at approximately 150km, 50km and 12km horizontal resolution, respectively) in a multi-variate framework. The analysis is carried out for the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT), a heat stress index that is commonly used in the context of working people and labour productivity. WBGT for shaded conditions depends on air temperature and dewpoint temperature, which in this work are individually bias-corrected prior to the index calculation. The aim of this work is twofold: First, the potential added value of bias-corrected RCMs over their bias-corrected GCM counterparts is assessed in present and future climate conditions. For this purpose, we evaluate the resulting WBGT and the models’ ability to represent the inter-variable relationships. Secondly, the two bias correction methods are compared in order to screen their strengths and weaknesses in present and future climate conditions.<\/p>"

Within  the BCIP two experiments focusing on different climate zones have been designed, namely: one on the mid-latitude climate taking the Euro-CORDEX simulations (50km) and the second on the tropical climate using the CORDEX-Africa simulations (50 km). 11 bias-adjustment approaches (different methods and the same methods with modifications) have  been  applied  to two  regional  climate  model  (SMHI-RCA4  and  IPSL-INERIS-WRF331F) simulations over Europe driven by the same global model (IPSL-CM5A-MR) under the RCP8.5 scenario.

Land Use\/Cover (LUC) interfaces: Wildland Urban Interface (WUI), Forest-Agricultural interface (FAI) and Forest-Grassland interface (FGI) have been derived and used as input drivers related to human-caused wildfire ignitions along with other variables such as orientation, precipitation, maximum temperature and live fuel moisture content (LFMC). A future LUC scenario by 2050 was run up by using Land Change Modeler (LCM). LCM transition susceptibility maps were calculated by neural networks and Markov chain matrices were used to determine the quantity of change. The model was calibrated with the observed LUCC between 1998 and 2008. Real 2015 map was used to assess model performance. Overall agreement between real and modeled maps was >90%. The trend scenario was run using drivers of change and restrictions to generate the LUC map for the year 2050, obtaining the future interfaces (WUI, FAI, FGI) from this map. Average projected precipitation and temperature for the 2050s for Spain were obtained from the regional climate model RACMO22E, from the KNMI, driven by the global climate model EC-EARTH and considering the two future experiments RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, which has been developed under the European branch of the CORDEX initiative (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cordex.org\/\" title=\"http:\/\/www.cordex.org\/\">http:\/\/www.cordex.org\/<\/a>), Euro-CORDEX, at 12x12 km approximately. In order to obtain the final resolution (1 km) of the climate indicators, the climate change signal (12 km), defined as the difference between the future and historical periods (delta), was added to the observed climatology (1km), obtaining the future climatology at 1km (Bedia et al., 2013). Note that this is the simplest bias calibration method which assumes a linear bias of the models which disappears when considering those deltas. LFMC from year 2005 was used for 2050 wildfire estimation as it was the most similar to 2050 in terms of climatic conditions. Wildfire occurrence prediction was finally obtained by applying the historical wildfire occurrence model to 2050 . Generally speaking future wildfire occurrence will increase in the study site.<\/p>"

For each species, we quantified four migration timing anomalies relative to a moving average central migration window (early, late, bimodal and condensed) and identified associations between environmental and phenological anomalies by multinomial logistic regression.

It is well accepted the positive role of increasing horizontal and vertical resolutions in numerical climate simulations. Generally speaking, the higher the resolution of the simulation, the better the representation of atmospheric processes. However, it is not clear if a relation between horizontal and vertical resolution should be kept for optimal model performance. In this regard a wide spectrum of combinations of horizontal and vertical resolutions in the simulations can be found in the literature. Also there is only sparse information about sensitivity to the time frequency at which model internally integrates. A set of 1-year long simulations on a Mediterranean domain with different combinations of horizontal (12.5, 25, 50 km), vertical (60, 40, 26) and temporal resolutions have been carried out using the WRF (Weather Research &amp; Forecasting) model as a regional climate downscaling tool. The results have been validated with different observed and re-analyzed fields in order to study the skill of each combination of vertical, horizontal and temporal resolution. The validation has been carried out in different regions defined using Köppen derived climatic zones, standard rectangular regions and a combination of both. Thus, the study attempts to provide an objective way to determine the appropriate resolution of a simulation based on meteorological aspects more than on computer limitations. At the same time, the importance of following an appropriate methodology to define the zones for verification is also shown.<\/p>"

The ability to forecast unusual climate conditions such as droughts or hot spells a few months in advance is particularly interesting in agriculture, energy requirements and other human affairs in order to avoid severe consequences. This study assesses the skill of state-of-the-art seasonal forecast considering five coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models from the Stream 2 multimodel experiment of the European ENSEMBLES Project.<br \/>\nThe methodology applied by Frías et al 2010 over Spain is here extended to the world to present a map of regions with a significant seasonal predictability related to ENSO. To this aim, seven month hindcast simulations produced four times per year (November, February, May and August initializations) in the period 1961-2000 are analyzed.<br \/>\nIn a first step, validations are carried out separately for each season; winter (DJF), spring (MAM), summer (JJA) and autumn (SON), considering both one and four-months lead time predictions (e.g. initializations of November and August are considered for winter). Then, since ENSO is considered to globally dominate interannual climate variability, the same process is repeated, but restricting validations exclusively to the years of the strongest El Niño and La Niña events.<br \/>\nThe obtained results indicate that models seem to capture the ENSO phenomenon, yielding statistically significant skill over vast areas of the globe (not only restricted to the tropics) in the whole period. Moreover, a substantial gain in skill is obtained for the ENSO-conditioned validations, identifying this phenomenon as a potential source of seasonal predictability. The intensity of this signal depends strongly on the season and location, being usually stronger for La Niña episodes than for El Niño ones. Seasonal forecasts from the five models present quite different behaviours and in most cases, the multimodel outperforms any single model skill.<br \/>\nA global study of ENSO teleconnections is also performed attempting to link the increase of skill found over certain regions in the ENSO-conditioned validations to the existence of teleconnections. In some cases ENSO clearly appears as the physical cause of the predictability (Northern South America and South Eastern Asia droughts in autumn are the most clear examples); however, in other cases there seems to be additional sources of predictability.<\/p>"

Episodes of cold waves and floodings have been observed in different areas of Europe affecting several socio-economic activities such as health or agriculture. More information about the physical processes involved is required to understand and evaluate the strong impacts of these events.<br \/>\nThis work is focused on the NAO-ENSO interactions that affect European climate anomalies and the predictability associated to these phenomena at a seasonal time-scale. Monthly precipitation and 2-meter temperature observations from the gridded E-OBS [1] dataset and hindcasts from the ENSEMBLES STREAM2 [2] multi-model seasonal forecast experiment are jointly analyzed in the period 1960-2000. The study is based on terciles following the methodology introduced by Frías et al 2010 [3], extended here to Europe. Monthly NAO index and averaged SST in El Niño3.4 region are used to characterize the large scale circulation. These indices are divided into three categories according to their terciles: positive, negative and neutral NAO, and El Niño, La Niña and neutral ENSO. Monthly validations have been carried out for every possible ENSO-NAO combination, assessing the resulting multimodel skill. It is concluded that predictability is much higher during these situations than when comparing to the whole period. A study of teleconnections is also done in order to check whether or not this increase of skill is connected to the NAO-ENSO phenomena. It is observed that, although NAO is the dominant mode of variability in Europe, ENSO acts as a modulator factor. It occurs for instance with the classic teleconnection found in winter over Spain when the negative phase of the NAO takes place (more rain than usual) which is intensified when coupling El Niño to the negative NAO.<\/p>\n<p>[1] Haylock, M.R., N.

Here, we present a systematic and rigorous statistical procedure to assess the skill of the state-of-the-art seasonal forecasting. To that aim, the seasonal ENSEMBLES multimodel (MME), constructed from the five global coupled models within STREAM 2, is validated in the whole Globe for the period 1961-2000.<br \/>\nThe methodology used is that introduced by Frías et al. 2010. Observations and hindcasts are divided into three categories, according to their terciles: less than normal, normal and above normal precipitation. Then, a probability is assigned to each tercile depending on the number of members forecasting it. The series with these probabilities and the real occurrence\/non occurrence of the target tercile permit to calculate skill scores. Two metrics are used: the Roc Skill Area (RSA) and the Hit Rate (HIR).<br \/>\nIn a first step, validations are performed for the whole period 1961-2000 in terms of RSA, obtaining a large predictability of the dry tercile over the tropics, especially intense in the northeastern parts of South America and Australia and in the Malay-archipelago in Autumn (at one-month leadtime). Then, since ENSO is known to affect seasonal predictability in these latitudes, validations are performed only in ENSO years, in order to check if this skill changes in the presence of this phenomenon.<br \/>\nResults show that skill increases strongly in the ENSO-conditioned validations, manifesting an important tropical predictability. Furthermore, a global study of ENSO-teleconnections is performed, concluding that ENSO-teleconnected areas are basically those in which predictability is largest. This fact points out the existence of a physical cause behind the skill. Finally, using HIR, it is proved that this tropical predictability has a different origin in non-ENSO years and in ENSO ones.<\/p>"

For such purpose, we cross-validate the different techniques focusing on three distinct aspects: 1) accuracy (correlation, etc.), 2) distributional similarity (KS and PDF scores), and 3) stationarity\/robustness under climate change conditions. For the latter, which is normally missed in state-of-the-art downscaling studies, we consider anomalous warm\/cold (temperature) and dry\/wet (precipitation) periods from the observational records - which serve as surrogates of possible future climate alterations - and test the performance of the methods, as compared to random periods. It is found that a near-perfect association between observed and downscaled series (e.g. high correlations) may hide important shortcomings in terms of distributional similarity and robustness. Therefore, a wide collection of downscaling configurations (domain-predictor-methodology) are evaluated in order to identify those being the most appropriate to deal with this issue.<br \/>\nThis study is part of the work done in the project ESTCENA, a strategic action of Plan Nacional de I+D+i 2008-2011.<\/p>"

The mean climatology for each calendar month was computed at seven different lead-times (each member was initialized the first of each month and was run for seven months). For instance,the climatology of January was computed considering the forecasts initialized the first of January (lead-month 0), December (lead-month 1) and so on until July (lead-month 6). Results show important drifts for some cases. Moreover, the differences between members are statistically not significant in general, what suggests that considering a single member may be enough to robustly remove the drift.<\/p>\n<p>In the near future, additional forecasting systems involved in EUPORIAS will be compared with System 4 in order to unveil possible commonalities in the drift climatology.<\/p>"

This workshop was motivated by the fact that, despite the large communities working in the identification of the reasons for the large range of model biases, very little work has been done in understanding the causes of the initial shock and in ways to reduce the impact of the drift. Scientists involved in the European projects SPECS and PREFACE were involved in this workshop whose format consisted in a set of brief presentations, followed by several discussion sessions. The questions addressed included the identification of the physical processes responsible for the model drift and the initial shock, their characterization, suggestions for model improvements that reduce the drift building on the continuous efforts to reduce the systematic error, considerations of how the initialisation strategy influences the skill and the best way to deal with the drift and the systematic error a posteriori and the need for bias correction. During the discussion, the attendants concluded that work should be done to understand how the initialisation affects the simulated variability, to distinguish between initial shock and drift, to investigate new methods to perform bias correction, to distinguish between the stationary and non stationary components of the error, to assess the impact of the initial shock on the skill, and to consider the sensitivity of the three terms to the parameter and model uncertainty. This talk will illustrate some of these aspects and offer more detailed conclusions and plans for the future in several European institutions.<\/p>"

To this aim, a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) approach is applied to downscale daily precipitation in the Philippines.<br \/>\nFirst, the GLMs are trained and tested -under a cross-validation scheme- separately for two distinct reanalyses (ERA-Interim and JRA-25) for the period 1981-2000. When the observed and downscaled time-series are compared, the attained performance is found to be sensitive to the reanalysis considered if climate change signal bearing variables (temperature and\/or specific humidity) are included in the predictor field. Moreover, performance differences are shown to be in correspondence with the disagreement found between the raw predictors from the two reanalyses.<br \/>\nSecond, the regression coefficients calibrated either with ERA-Interim or JRA-25 are subsequently applied to the output of a Global Climate Model (MPI-ECHAM5) in order to assess the sensitivity of local-scale climate change projections (up to 2100) to reanalysis choice. In this case, the differences detected in present climate conditions are considerably amplified, leading to \"delta-change\" estimates differing by up to a 35% (on average for the entire country) depending on the reanalysis used for calibration.<br \/>\nTherefore, reanalysis choice is shown to importantly contribute to the uncertainty of local-scale climate change projections, and, consequently, should be treated with equal care as other, well-known, sources of uncertainty -e.g., the choice of the GCM and\/or downscaling method.- Implications of the results for the entire tropics, as well as for the Model Output Statistics downscaling approach are also briefly discussed.<\/p>"

All these techniques have been extensively used and critically assessed in climate change applications; however, their advantages and limitations for (probabilistic) seasonal forecasting are not well understood yet, and there is currently some controversy on whether or not these techniques can improve the skill of the forecasts. This is a complex problem due to the multifaceted aspects involved in the validation of probabilistic predictions (accuracy, sharpness, reliability).<\/p>\n<p>In this contribution we analyze this problem by applying two bias correction and two perfect prog state-of-the-art methods to downscale seasonal precipitation forecasts from the ENSEMBLES multi-model hindcast in a challenging skilfull region in the tropics with high quality observational data. We show that bias correction provides no significant skill improvement for those skill scores not affected by data scaling (ie. those robust to a change in the mean and\/or variance of the data). As a consequence, the skill improvement found in previous works is just a consequence of a mean\/variance correction of the data and could be achieved with a simple linear scaling correction. However, perfect prog methods can yield significant skill increments (due to effective improvements of the interannual variability) in certain cases for which the large-scale predictor variables used are better predicted by the model than the target precipitation. Moreover, these windows of opportunity might be related to the existence of significant ENSO teleconnection signals. <\/p>\n<p>We conclude on some recommendations on the use of the different post-processing approaches in the framework of seasonal forecasting.<\/p>"

To partially alleviate these problems, Maraun et al. (2017) advocated the development of process-informed BC methods, combining the statistical modeling with the knowledge about the relevant processes for the problem under study. However, the application of this type of methods remains unexplored yet for the case of seasonal forecasts. Thus, this work assesses the suitability of a first simple attempt for processconditioned BC in the context of seasonal forecasting. To do this, we focus on the northwestern part of Peru and bias correct one- and four-month lead seasonal predictions of boreal winter precipitation from the ECMWF System4. In order to include information about the underlying large-scale circulation which may help to discriminate between precipitation affected by different processes, we introduce here an empirical quantile-quantile mapping which runs conditioned on the state of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), which is accurately predicted by System4 and is known to affect the local climate. Our results show that a standard implementation in which the quantile-quantile mapping is directly applied over the entire period of study (1981-2010) broadly preserves the temporal structure of the raw model precipitation and, as a consequence, does not improve its unskillful predictions -beyond correcting the mean biases.- Contrarily, the SOI-conditioned version presented here (which is separately applied for three different sets of years; defined according to the terciles of the SOI) can modify the temporal sequence of the raw model output, providing more realistic local time-series, which results in improved ROC Skill Scores and reliability over the entire study area. This suggest that conditioning the bias correction on simple but wellsimulated large-scale processes relevant to the local climate may be a suitable approach for seasonal forecasting.<\/p>"

A key aspect for the success of the C3S is the Evaluation and Quality Control (EQC) function that provides quality assurance information for all products and ensures that users have access to the information they need to use the service. The QA4Seas (Quality Assurance for Multi-model Seasonal Forecast Products, C3S_51 Lot3) contract, which has been finished successfully in September 2018, aimed at developing a strategy for the EQC of multi model seasonal forecasts provided by the C3S in response to the needs of a wide range of stakeholders of the CDS from sectors like water resources management, agriculture, health, energy, or disaster preparedness.<br \/>\nIn this contribution, we first present some of the key components of QA4Seas such as a survey identifying the needs of CDS users and the development of a software prototype of the EQC system, and a solution to provide provenance metadata together with both forecast products and EQC information. Secondly, as aimed primarily in the contract, we make recommendations on how to evaluate operational seasonal forecasts available through the CDS. Proper verification of seasonal forecasts shows that the information provided by current systems has limitations and forecast quality varies strongly in space, in time (both lead time and forecast valid time), by parameter and forecast system. Further, seasonal forecast models suffer from systematic biases and dispersion errors that need to be corrected in order to render the forecasts useable. Based on an in-depth analysis of global seasonal hindcasts issued monthly from 1993 to 2014 provided by the ECMWF System 5, the Met Office Glosea5, and the Météo-France System 5 sources, we stress the importance of processing both ensemble forecasts and multi-category probability forecasts differently. Results for the three variables used for illustration purposes, near surface temperature, sea surface temperature, and precipitation, underpin the need for bias adjustment in case of ensemble forecasts, but not for multi-category probability forecasts. Likewise, seasonal predictions benefit from applying multi-model combination tailored to the forecast format. Recommendations have been issued to formulate operational forecasts in the context of bias-adjusted, multi-model forecast products.<\/p>"

The framework allows for comprehensive end-to-end sectoral reproducible applications through the interoperability of different specific R packages. One of the core packages is loadeR, the climate4R catalog- and subset-oriented data access tool from either local or remote (OpeNDAP) data sources, which is transparently linked to the Santander Climate Data Service (UDG), providing a wide catalogue of popular datasets (incl. CMIP and CORDEX) to climate4R users. As part of the climate4R ecosystem, the package downscaleR provides tools for bias adjustment and statistical downscaling, covering the most popular techniques (e.g. analogs, LMs and GLMs, and neural networks), and allowing for multiple experiment configurations and cross-validation options. climate4R was used to contribute to the VALUE intercomparison experiment, and will be used in ongoing experiments in the framework of EURO-CORDEX. <\/p>\n<p>In order to illustrate the functionalities of downscaleR and climate4R, we present a fully reproducible worked example from the VALUE contribution, obtaining local climate change projections for a set of 86 stations over Europe. We first replicate the VALUE 1A Experiment (with reanalysis predictors) using an extended set of methods. Then, we describe ongoing work with GCM predictors to compute the climate change signal for the late XXI century and analyze the spread resulting from the ensemble of statistical downscaling methods used.<\/p>\n<p>Climate data processing typically involves complex error-prone operations. In this sense, climate4R provides a unique framework where common tasks such as statistical downscaling can be straightforwardly performed in a few lines of code. The development of climate4R is a community effort boosted by the contribution to several international initiatives, such as the IPCC WGI activities of the Atlas Chapter.<\/p>"

Despite being crucial for the development of better adaptation strategies and policy making, it is difficult for a typical user of this kind of information to understand the differences that may be expected across the different data sources available for a given region (different domains, GCM\/RCM ensembles, resolutions, etc.). This is the case for a number of regions of particular interest which are covered by more than one CORDEX domain. A relevant question in those cases is the consistency and potential conflicts which may arise for the projections provided by different domains. This work addresses this hot topic by focusing on the Mediterranean region, a first illustrative case-study which is encompassed by the EURO-, AFR- and MED-CORDEX domains.<br \/>\nTo do so, we first assess the performance of a common multi-domain set of RCMs to simulate a number of precipitation-related indicators (accounting for spells and high-order moments) when driven with ERA-Interim data. Preliminary results from this “perfect” validation experiment indicate that the effect of the choice of domain is in general small. Second, to assess whether or not these small differences become relevant when the RCMs are driven by GCMs, we also inter-compare the climate change signals projected by the full ensemble of GCM\/RCM combinations available for the EURO-, MED- and AFR-CORDEX domains, as well as for those obtained for the common set of simulations available for the three domains. This allows to better characterize the uncertainty that is present in CORDEX climate change simulations, covering not only the main factors which have been traditionally analyzed (choice of GCM, RCM, scenario) but also a new one which has not been taken into account before (the choice of domain). The results from this study will help different users’ communities to better frame their decisions for impact applications.<br \/>\nMoreover, we plan to broaden this study by applying the same methodology to other regions of the world where RCM-based simulations coming from different CORDEX domains are also available.<\/p>"

In this study we used the Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI) and its components to determine what relationships exist between fire danger and monthly number of fires and burned area across Spain, and how these relationships have varied in the last 35 years. We analyzed fire statistics (number of fires and burned area, 1974-2008), and the ERA-40 reanalysis database (1974-2001) as input for constructing the FWI. We performed trend analysis and maximum likelihood fire-climate models for the various regions within peninsular Spain and the Balearic Islands. Despite the overall trend of increasing FWI in most of Spain during the last decades, our study shows that different regions have been undergoing different trends. While in some regions an increasing trend in the number of fires was detected, in others the opposite trend was detected. Some regions did not exhibit any pattern in burned area, but in some a decreasing trend was demonstrated. In addition, we found significant relationships between the number of fires and monthly burned area and fire danger indices considering just the meteorological variables. In general, as FWI increased more fires or more burned area occurred. In the most Northern regions, where milder climatic conditions and lower fire danger indices are prevalent, fire activity was highest and so were the correlations between the number of fires and burned area. However, Central, Southern and Eastern regions showed no fires below a threshold (FWI of 5 to 10), but then, fire activity increased up to values of FWI of 40-50. It is remarkable that the relationships varied among regions, some having a saturating-type of relationship while others a more exponential one. The goodness of fit and the variance explained by the models was remarkable for some regions. Most of the Mediterranean regions were the most poorly related to the FWI. Therefore, at least some of the regions with greatest fire activity were not predictable. Overall, our study shows that annual burned area is not increasing in Spain in most regions, and even decreasing in some, despite increased fire danger conditions. Yet, the significant relationships between FWI and burned area indicates that ignitions and fire fighting capacity might be controlling the lack of, or negative, trend in burned area demonstrated for some regions.<\/p>"

Moreover, this problem may be aggravated when predicting potential distributions in the future as a consequence of the uncertainty derived from the future altered climate scenarios. Faced with this problem a high resolution grid for the Basque Country has been developed as an alternative to existing public products: The Regional Baseline Climate of the Basque Country (RCBC).

METACLIP (METAdata for CLImate Products) is a language-independent framework envisaged to tackle the problem of climate product provenance description. The solution proposed is based on semantics exploiting web standard Resource Description Framework (RDF), through the design of domain-specific extensions of standard vocabularies (e.g. PROV-O) describing the different aspects involved in climate product generation. By introducing semantics in the metadata description, METACLIP ensures an effective communication of the information to a wide range of users with different levels of expertise. We present the METACLIP Framework through a bias correction example application within the open source R computing environment and in the context of climate4R, a bundle of climate-oriented R packages, in which a full RDF semantic description of the different elements composing a bias correction product (a climate index future climatology) is produced. A specific on-line application for metadata visualization and interactive exploration is also presented, helping all types of users to trace and understand the provenance of the climate data products. A conceptual framework for the development of a specific bias correction vocabulary is proposed, and a call is done to the community of bias correction experts for possible contributions.<\/p>"

In the area of Galicia (NW Spain) this trend has also been determined. The main objective of this work is to assess actual and future trends of different extreme indices of temperature, which are of crucial importance for many impact studies.<\/p>\n<p>As direct GCM-output significantly underestimates the variance of daily surface temperature variables in NW Spain, these are obtained by applying a statistical downscaling technique (analog method), using 850hPa temperature and mean sea level pressure as combined predictors. The predictor fields have been extracted from a multi-model multi initial conditions ensemble of 14 runs of three GCMs participating in the IPCC AR4.<\/p>\n<p>For 1960-2006 results show a significant increase of the number of days with maximum temperatures above the 90th percentile. Furthermore, a significant decrease of the days with maximum temperatures below the 10th percentile has been found. The tendencies of minimum temperatures are reverse: less nights with minimum temperatures below the 10th percentile and more with minimum temperatures above 90th percentile. Those tendencies can be observed all over the year, but are more pronounced in summer. Results for relationship between the above mentioned extreme values and different North Atlantic teleconnection patterns show that local tendencies are associated with trends of EA (Eastern Atlantic) and SCA (Scandinavian) patterns. The NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation) only in winter is related to the number of cold days.<\/p>\n<p>The ensemble climate projections generated with the analog method indicate that the observed (linear) trends of maximum and minimum temperatures in NW Spain are expected to continue in the next decades. Furthermore the uncertainty interval of these projections (2021-2050) is dominated by model uncertainties rather than by forcing uncertainties.<\/p>\n<p>We conclude that more frequent hot days as well as an increasing probability of summertime heat waves are to be expected in the next decades. Cold days tend to diminish, decreasing the probability of wintertime cold waves and leaving a greater part of the area under study without frost throughout the year.<\/p>"

A three-step method is followed:<br \/>\nFirst, from air temperature at 850 hPa and mean sea level pressure (T850MSLP), chosen to be the best predictor combination for the purpose of this study, the error of the AN under optimal conditions is estimated. Besides a negative bias found for the maximum temperatures in spring the statistical properties of all predictands are reproduced well in every season of the year.<br \/>\nIn a second step, the T850MSLP-fields of 5 AR4-GCM control-runs of a multi-model, multi-initial conditions ensemble (MMMICE) are used to downscale the predictands, thus obtaining the total uncertainty. Neither the predictor data nor the downscaled series are corrected by bias adjusting, variance inflation or randomisation. While the individual downscaled series cannot reproduce the CDFs of local observations, their combination performs quite well during summer and autumn.<br \/>\nIn a third step 14 scenario-runs of the MMMICE are used to generate summer (JJA) projections until 2050. Downscaled series from JJA 2021-2050 (scenario period) are compared to observations from JJA 1973-2002 (reference period) in order to detect local climate change:<br \/>\nIn addition to the mean relative warming it can be shown that the relationship between the relative frequency of daytime heat-events in the reference period and its frequency increase in the scenario period is described by a descending exponential function. For nighttime warm-events a linear relationship can be assumed. Model uncertainties rather than forcing or initial conditions uncertainties dominate the spread in the scenario period.<br \/>\nWe conclude that climate projections downscaled from only one GCM should be treated with caution, particularly if they refer to the probability of future extreme events. This holds especially if their corresponding control-run versions are not validated and\/or the projections are given relatively to the control-period. By increasing the number of GCM-ensemble members and optimizing the domain as a function of each member´s skillful scale local CDFs may be reliably reproduced throughout every season of the year.<\/p>"

The present study provides a high resolution analysis of the relationship between ARs and EPE throughout<br \/>\nthe Iberian Atlantic Margin (IAM).<\/p>"

On the Spanish Iberian Peninsula (the region of interest in the present study), there currently exit 89 wine production areas. 67 of them pertain to the “Denomination of Origin”, 2 to “Denomination of Origin Qualified”, 6 are quality wines with geographical indication and 14 are “Wine Appellation”, i.e. strictly follow the EU directives for production, enological practices and quality control.

Firstly, high-resolution 31-year climatological maps for 3 commonly used viticultural zoning indices are generated which cover the whole Spanish Iberian Peninsula. For this specific region, we used a high resolution dataset for daily precipitation and temperature (Spain02). This database is provided on a regular 0.2º grid , spanning the time period 1950 to 2007, and was provided by the Santander Meteorology Group (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meteo.unican.es\/en\/datasets\/spain02\" title=\"http:\/\/www.meteo.unican.es\/en\/datasets\/spain02\">http:\/\/www.meteo.unican.es\/en\/datasets\/spain02<\/a>). The 3 bioclimatic indices applied here for the purpose of viticultural zoning are the Winkler index (WI), the Huglin index (HI) and the hydrothermic index of Branas, Bernon and Levadoux (BBLI), which, among others, have been frequently applied in previous studies. Secondly, a set of four regional climate models (RCM) from the ENSEMBLES project (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ensembles-eu.org\/\" title=\"http:\/\/www.ensembles-eu.org\/\">http:\/\/www.ensembles-eu.org\/<\/a> ) is used to generate climate change projections for the 3 mentioned viticultural indices until the end of the 21st century. The models considered were BCM-RCA, ECHAM5-RCA, ECHAM5- REMO and HADCM3-RCA at a resolution of 25 km for the A1B scenario. Current conditions were analyzed for the period 1961–1991 and future conditions for the period 2061–2091. With the data obtained from the four models, the Winkler, Huglin and BBL indices and their trends for the period 1961–2091 were calculated.<\/p>"

In this view, each AGCM run – here from AMIP and ERA-20CM – is one unique realization of the atmosphere and the probabilistic nature of the response can be mimicked by considering the conjunction of runs (ensemble). Using the correlation coefficient (r) to describe the strength and sign of the teleconnections, a simple statistical test is proposed to obtain a confidence interval for variations in r that are caused by internal atmospheric variability. The utility of this test is then shown through applying it to a wide range of teleconnections seen in the observational record. Teleconnections to the extratropics are generally not robust to perturbation through internal variability, particularly if they are drawn from short sub-periods of the twentieth century. In this case, albeit the results from individual model runs exhibit nonstationarities similar to those seen in observations, the CI including the effects of internal variability is approximately constant in time. Hence, it is argued that many of the “short-term” teleconnections seen in observations just arose, because the unique realization of internal variability in the real atmosphere was favourable for its development. This implies 1) that modulation by climate oscillations operating on lower frequencies (e.g. the PDO and AMO) is not needed to explain the nonstationarities seen in observations and 2) that empirical relationships drawn from the deterministic observational record not hold if applied in the future, meaning that statistical forecasting schemes based on these rules are unreliable.<\/p>"

One of the advantages of WRF is the possibility<br \/>\nof choosing between a large number of the-state-of-art parametrization schemes. However, there is no consensus about the set of schemes that performs better for each particular experiment. Frequently the skill depends on the variables to be validated, or the process to be simulated, and there is not such thing as a best model configuration. In the case of the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) schemes, a number of sensitivity studies have been carried out, but they lack generality in terms of spatial extent and time span, since they are usually validated for a particular event, season or location. The aim of this work is to analyse the influence of factors like orography, latitude, and season in the sensitivity of WRF to the PBL scheme and in the systematic errors. In order to explore this, the year 2001 was simulated in a domain covering all Europe, using ERAINTERIM boundary conditions, and with three different PBL schemes. The simulations are compared with each other, with soundings and with bias significantly depends on the season, being warm in winter and cold in summer. This is due to the strong warm bias developed by the model in stable enviroments, specially when using the Yonsei University non-local scheme. Other variables show a similar behaviour.<\/p>"

Accordingly, the wind resource process can be described by the following cascade activities: the coarse spatial wind fields from global meteorological experiments; the regional winds from a dynamic downscaling coupled to the global reanalysis fields; the validation and calibration procedures by using instrumental observations; and, finally, the characterization of winds for evaluation of the wind resource.

Offshore wind is affected by complex coastlines and coastal orography, which interact with the winds and meteorological systems by adding regional features. Thus, high-resolution wind products are usually demanded. Moreover, the characterization of extreme events also requires high temporal resolution to capture peak winds which may affect infrastructures. We present a set of high resolution (15 km, hourly) wind data sets produced using the WRF model to downscale the ERA-Interim and NCEP\/NCAR reanalyses. The simulation domain covers Europe (i.e. different wind regimes). In order to follow the driving reanalysis as closely as possible, the model was restarted daily. Results show that WRF is able to produce realistic offshore wind climatologies, including wind probability distribution, annual cycle and well-known regional winds.<\/p>"

The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was used to produce an ensemble of 9 different configurations. These included not only physical parameterizations, but also other options.

However, the evaluation process is still facing important challenges.  Climate models are complex programs that manage many variables and are adjusted with many parameters, some of which are difficult or impossible to measure (Mauritsen et al. 2012).  In most evaluation studies, only a few variables are used, being precipitation and temperature the most popular ones. Furthermore, there is not a clear enough discrimination between the calibration and evaluation processes. This can lead to reduce the bias balancing out errors, instead of obtaining a better physical realism.<br \/>\nIn this context, multi-physics ensembles (MPEs) appear as an interesting methodology. These ensembles are built by perturbing a model changing the physical parameterizations used to represent unresolved phenomena (e.g., microphysics, cumulus, etc). In this work, our goal is to show how a multi-variable analysis of an MPE can be used to improve the understanding of the physical realism of a model, and of the sources of uncertainty. With this aim, a MPE is analysed looking not only P&amp;T, but also radiation fluxes, cloud cover, soil moisture and albedo.<\/p>"

In order to evaluate those fluxes and thereby the reproduction of boundary layer processes by the<br \/>\nmodels, latent and sensible heat fluxes are compared for individual locations against flux tower measurements of<br \/>\nthe FLUXNET dataset. An important prerequisite for a valid intercomparison is e.g. a match of the dominant land<br \/>\nuse as used by the land surface schemes in the RCMs with the station site. As most RCMs in the intercomparison<br \/>\nuse the NOAH LSM with MODIS land use and USGS GTOPO topographic data, our intercomparison does not<br \/>\nnecessarily give an information on the quality of the LSM but is rather intended to investigate the overall effects<br \/>\nof the complex interplay of several processes.<\/p>"

The heterogeneity of architectures and systems along with the different configuration schemas has led to a situation where users find very complicated taking advantage of all the resources available.<\/p>\n<p>In order to solve this problem, a new computing paradigm called “Grid Computing” appeared as an alternative for flexible access to heterogeneous and geographically distributed computing resources. Typically, creating a Grid infrastructure requires coordination among cluster administrators and the installation of a middleware to unify the access to them. <\/p>\n<p>Nowadays, users have access to some resources, like HPC infrastructures, which are not shared using any Grid middleware. Under this situation, the user has to manage separately the access to each non-Grid infrastructure, which is quite cumbersome.<\/p>\n<p>The challenge of this work is to unify the access to Grid and non-Grid resources, allowing researchers to perform huge experiments making use of all the available resources. To achieve this goal, common LRMs used in HPC infrastructures: PBS\/Torque, SGE and SLURM and Grid middleware: gLite, GT2.4 and GT4\/5 has been considered.<\/p>\n<p>Although nowadays there are several Grid meta-schedulers, none of them has the capabilities needed. To solve the problem of unified access to Grid and non-Grid resources, the GridWay meta-scheduler and his plugin oriented architecture has been used.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, as Gridway doesn’t provide access to non Grid resources, new GridWay plugins which grant access to non-Grid resources (PBS\/Torque, SGE and SLURM) have been developed. These plugins are based on the raw access to clusters provided to the users; typically a ssh account and LRM’s CLI.<\/p>\n<p>As an application of this tool it has been integrated into the WRF4G framework. WRF is high demanding application of HPC resources. WRF4G is a framework that allows the management of the execution of huge experiments, consisting in thousands of jobs (HTC). With this tool we are providing a homogeneous access to Grid and non-Grid resources to the WRF4G users. <\/p>\n<p>The Earth Sciences community, in particular Climate &amp; Weather community, is high demanding HPC user community, therefore it will benefit from this unification of Grid and non-Grid resources.<\/p>"

As opposite to other application-oriented models, WRF provides<br \/>\na flexible and computationally-efficient framework which allows solving a variety of problems for different<br \/>\ntime-scales, from weather forecast to climate change projection. Furthermore, WRF is also widely used as a<br \/>\nresearch tool in modeling physics, dynamics, and data assimilation by the research community.<br \/>\nClimate experiment workflows based on Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) are nowadays among<br \/>\nthe one of the most cutting-edge applications. These workflows are complex due to both large storage and the<br \/>\nhuge number of simulations executed. In order to manage that, we have developed a scientific gateway (SG) called<br \/>\nWRF for Scientific Gateway (WRF4SG) based on WS-PGRADE\/gUSE and WRF4G frameworks to ease achieve<br \/>\nWRF users needs (see [1] and [2]).<br \/>\nWRF4SG provides services for different use cases that describe the different interactions between WRF<br \/>\nusers and the WRF4SG interface in order to show how to run a climate experiment. As WS-PGRADE\/gUSE<br \/>\nuses portlets (see [1]) to interact with users, its portlets will support these use cases. A typical experiment to be<br \/>\ncarried on by a WRF user will consist on a high-resolution regional re-forecast. These re-forecasts are common<br \/>\nexperiments used as input data form wind power energy and natural hazards (wind and precipitation fields). In the<br \/>\ncases below, the user is able to access to different resources such as Grid due to the fact that WRF needs a huge<br \/>\namount of computing resources in order to generate useful simulations:<br \/>\n* Resource configuration and user authentication: The first step is to authenticate on users’ Grid resources<br \/>\nby virtual organizations. After login, the user is able to select which virtual organization is going to be used by the<br \/>\nexperiment.<br \/>\n* Data assimilation: In order to assimilate the data sources, the user has to select them browsing through<br \/>\nLFC Portlet.<br \/>\n* Design Experiment workflow: In order to configure the experiment, the user will define the type of experiment<br \/>\n(i.e. re-forecast), and its attributes to simulate. In this case the main attributes are: the field of interest (wind,<br \/>\nprecipitation, ...), the start and end date simulation and the requirements of the experiment.<br \/>\n* Monitor workflow: In order to monitor the experiment the user will receive notification messages based on<br \/>\nevents and also the gateway will display the progress of the experiment.<br \/>\n* Data storage: Like Data assimilation case, the user is able to browse and view the output data simulations using<br \/>\nLFC Portlet.<br \/>\nThe objectives of WRF4SG can be described by considering two goals. The first goal is to show how<br \/>\nWRF4SG facilitates to execute, monitor and manage climate workflows based on the WRF4G framework. And<br \/>\nthe second goal of WRF4SG is to help WRF users to execute their experiment workflows concurrently using<br \/>\nheterogeneous computing resources such as HPC and Grid.<br \/>\n[1] Kacsuk, P.: P-GRADE portal family for grid infrastructures.

This community develop its research activity on different areas and could benefit from the advantages<br \/>\nof Grid resources (case study simulations, regional hind-cast\/forecast, sensitivity studies, etc.). The WRF model is<br \/>\nbeen used as input by many energy and natural hazards community, therefore those community will also benefit.<br \/>\nHowever, Grid infrastructures have some drawbacks for the execution of applications that make an intensive<br \/>\nuse of CPU and memory for a long period of time.

This middleware encapsulates the application and provides appropriate services for the monitoring<br \/>\nand management of the jobs and the data. Thus, the second objective of the project consists on the development<br \/>\nof a generic adaptation of WRF for Grid (WRF4G), to be distributed as open-source and to be integrated in the<br \/>\nofficial WRF development cycle. The use of this WRF adaptation should be transparent and useful to face any<br \/>\nof the previously described studies, and avoid any of the problems of the Grid infrastructure. Moreover it should<br \/>\nsimplify the access to the Grid infrastructures for the research teams, and also to free them from the technical and<br \/>\ncomputational aspects of the use of the Grid.<br \/>\nFinally, in order to demonstrate the ability of Grid infrastructures in solving a scientific problem with interest<br \/>\nand relevance on the meteorology area (implying a high computational cost) we will perform a high<br \/>\nresolution hindcast on Southwestern Europe with ERA-Interim re-analysis as boundary and initial conditions.<br \/>\nThe production of an atmospheric hindcast at high resolution, will provide an appropriate assessment of the<br \/>\npossibilities and uncertainties of the WRF model for the evaluation and forecasting of weather, energy and natural<br \/>\nhazards.<br \/>\n[1] <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meteo.unican.es\/software\/wrf4g\" title=\"http:\/\/www.meteo.unican.es\/software\/wrf4g\">http:\/\/www.meteo.unican.es\/software\/wrf4g<\/a><\/p>"

This community is heterogeneous both in terms of application domains and Distributed Computing Infrastructure (DCI) profiles. WRF researches are physicists, chemists, mathematicians and engineers who demand a huge variety of DCIs in order to tackle climate experiments such as operational weather forecast, chemistry applications, regional projections of climate change scenarios or atmospheric physics\/parametrization research by using WRF.<br \/>\nWRF modeling system is composed of several components which are executed sequentially. Myriad of input and output files have to be managed and monitored in order to run a WRF simulation. Therefore, when a experiment requires executing more than one simulation, its complexity rises almost exponentially demanding an enormous effort for a researcher.<br \/>\nThis work proposes to develop a scientific gateway which is going to provide the services needed to perform WRF experiments on heterogeneous DCIs. In addition, it will offer a set of saving time tools in order to design, monitor and manage complex climate experiments such as weather forecast, extreme weather case studies, future climate projections or re-forecasts. This scientific gateway, called WRF4SG (WRF for Scientific Gateway), consists in porting WRF4G application to the WS-PGRADE\/gUSE framework, which provides a wide access to DCIs and the possibility to design more complex experiments by creating specific portlets.<br \/>\nFinally, the objective of WRF4SG is able to divide into two goals.

The framework aims at simplifying the model access by releasing climate scientists from technical and computational aspects.<\/p>\n<p>In this contribution, we present some new advances of the WRF4G framework, including new components for designing experiments, simulation monitoring and data management. Additionally, we will show how WRF4G makes possible to run complex experiments on EGI infrastructures concurrently over several VOs such as esr and earth.vo.ibergrid.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meteo.unican.es\/software\/wrf4g\" title=\"http:\/\/www.meteo.unican.es\/software\/wrf4g\">http:\/\/www.meteo.unican.es\/software\/wrf4g<\/a><\/p>\n<p>This work has been partially funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Spanish National R&amp;D Plan 2008-2011 (CGL2011-28864, WRF4G)<\/p>"

Additionally, there are available a large variety of DCIs such as workstations, clusters, grid services or clouds with different Distributed Resource Managements (DRM) as well. This issue can represent a significant barrier for scientists. Therefore, tools to homogenize the access to these DCIs are one of the most important challenges facing.<br \/>\nTo deal with this issue, several approaches have been proposed from a resource admin's point of view. In this work is introduced a new solution to give homogenous access to DCIs but without resource admin intervention. This solution, named DRM4G, aims to expand the possibilities of scientists using it for their computing models. One example of that is WRF4G framework that is used for simulating large-scale climate experiments. This framework takes advantages of DRM4G to provide a homogeneous access between WRF4G users and DCIs. In order to achieve this, DRM4G enables the submission and management of jobs to DRMs such as FORK, PBS\/Torque, SGE, LSF, LoadLeveler and SLURM and grid EGI services such as Globus and CREAM.<\/p>\n<p>Acknowledgment<br \/>\nThis work is partially funded by the Spanish PLAN NACIONAL de I+D+i 2008-2011 (WRF4G, Ref.# CGL2011-28864) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).<\/p>"

Future projections vary significantly depending on model algorithms and parameterizations, however, the evaluation of SDMs under future climate change is problematic, as events being predicted have yet not occurred. In front of the lack of an objective basis to perform a selection of various alternatives,  we propose a method incorporating niche overlap metrics, for the selection of credible future projections under an ecologically meaningful basis. This method allows the discrimination of useful SDMs from ill-performing ones. In addition, given that the pseudo-absences used to train the model are known to have a significant impact on the results obtained, we analyse this source of uncertainty in future projections for each tested SDM. <\/p>\n<p>We apply the developed method on three phylogenies of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) in Europe, considering three different modelling algorithms and a set of four state of the art regional-global climate model couplings , thus accounting for the main sources of uncertainty of future SDM projections. Finally, we calculate the range of probabilities of future projections obtained from models built for 10 runs of pseuso-absence data generation. Two pseudo-absence generation methods are compared, the commonly used random sampling (RS) and the improved Three-step method (TS).<\/p>\n<p>The niche overlap metric approach enabled an objective quality assessment of each individual SDM. The less complex algorithm (GLM) produced the most credible future projections. Contrarily, MARS (and to a lesser extent also MAXENT) projected the less credible future distributions due to model overfitting. The uncertainty related to pseudo-absence data was also lower for GLM, specially when the TS method was used. Therefore, we conclude that the use of a parsimonious algorithm is the best option in the context of future predictions.<\/p>"

The model is coupled to the Noah land surface model.

In the latter, we used a Kain-Fritsch mass flux scheme<br \/>\nto represent convective processes. All sensitivity simulations were forced by the<br \/>\nERA-Interim reanalysis.<br \/>\nIn order to investigate the sensitivity of the model to the land use distribution, a<br \/>\nwidely used dataset provided with WRF (based on USGS) was replaced with a<br \/>\nnewer, more detailed data set (based on CORINE), which has been re-mapped<br \/>\nto keep the same land use categories of the former (Pineda et al., 2004), thus<br \/>\ntesting only the sensitivity to the new soil distribution. The differences between<br \/>\nboth datasets (Figure 1a vs 1b) consist mainly on an increase of urban areas and<br \/>\ncroplands, due to changes over time (1993 vs. 2012).

Debido al impacto que estos procesos producen en términos económicos y sociales, resulta crucial entender su comportamiento y evolución en un clima futuro. Por este motivo, la iniciativa internacional CORDEX (Coordinated Regional climate Downscaling Experiment) ha dedicado recientemente uno de sus estudios piloto a la convección en Europa; el llamado Flagship Pilot Study on Convection Permitting Climate Modelling (FPS-CPCM, Coppola et al., 2018). Se trata de abordar el estudio de la convección mediante un conjunto de modelos con una resolución suficiente para resolver explícitamente la convección. Nuestro objetivo en este trabajo es presentar los experimentos que componen este estudio piloto, junto con sus primeros resultados. En particular, estudiamos la representación de una serie de eventos de precipitación extrema en simulaciones con diferentes alcances, y evaluamos la incertidumbre en el marco de la variabilidad natural a estas escalas.<\/p>\n<p><b>Publicación:<\/b><br \/>\nA Lavín, J Fernández, RM.

To this aim, 3 heavy precipitation events were selected and simulated in two modes: weather-like (WL, initialized a few hours before the event) and climate mode (CM, initialized one month ahead). The WRF model community devised, for this initial experiment, a multi-physics ensemble, to explore physical parameterization uncertainty.

This experiment resulted in noticeable discrepancies<br \/>\nbetween models in representing selected heavy precipitation events. The groups using the Weather and<br \/>\nResearch Forecasting (WRF) model organized a multi-physics ensemble, suited to identify the processes<br \/>\nbehind those discrepancies. In this work we analyze the uncertainty arising from internal variability in this<br \/>\nmulti-physics ensemble at one-month and one-year timescales. To distinguish the uncertainty due to the use<br \/>\nof different parameterizations from that of the internal variability, a set of simulations with perturbed initial<br \/>\nconditions was performed. We measured quantitatively the uncertainty arising from both sources using<br \/>\ninter-member variances. For circulation variables, the results suggest that uncertainties from multi-physics<br \/>\nand internal variability have comparable magnitude, exhibiting an annual cycle with higher values in summer<br \/>\nthan in winter. The spatial distribution of the uncertainties show similar patterns, with higher values over the<br \/>\nnortheastern part of the domain. These patterns are in agreement with previous studies which conclude that<br \/>\ninternal variability increases where the inflow of the boundary information is less dominant: that is, in<br \/>\nsummer when the boundary forcing is not able to overcome the local-scale processes, and far from the<br \/>\nwesterly flow coming from the north Atlantic. The behaviour of uncertainty also depends on the variable.<br \/>\nSurface variables are more affected by parameterized processes (soil physics, boundary layer, clouds, etc.),<br \/>\nhence the uncertainty associated to the parameterizations has more decisive role for these variables than for<br \/>\ncirculation variables.<\/p>"

One important motivation to perform this study is the greater vulnerability of ecosystems to climate extremes than to mean climate changes. The extreme indices are based on threshold exceedance. We use the daily gridded datasets derived through interpolation of station data (E-OBS) version 2.0 (Hofstra et al. 2009).  The variability of the indices would be described by using probability density function (PDF), Singular Spectral Analysis (SSA) and different procedures to derive the significance of the trend. The changes in the temperature extreme indices are explained taken into account the atmospheric teleconnection indices and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) variability modes and by means of correlation analysis and composite maps of large-scale variables for the most extreme values of the indices.  We will discuss results for the four seasons and provide more additional details with respect to a previous study where temperature extremes of annual time series were analyzed over the Iberian Peninsula (Rodriguez-Puebla et al. 2010). Statistical models are proposed to characterize the temperature extreme indices to be applied in further studies about climate change conditions and to learn how slow climate changes would affect the variability of temperature extremes.  <\/p>\n<p>Hofstra, N; Haylock, M; New, M; Jones, PD (2009) Testing E-OBS European high-resolution gridded data set of daily precipitation and surface temperature.

Particularly, we focus our analysis on consecutive wet days index (CWD) and highest one day precipitation amount (RX1DAY), due to the importance of these extremes in different socio-economic sectors such as agriculture applications. Extreme precipitation indices were computed from daily gridded dataset derived through interpolation of station data (EOBS) version 4.0 (Haylock et al. 2008, Hofstra et al. 2009) for the period 1950-2010. We explain the different trends and variability of extreme precipitation indices by considering the effects of teleconnection patterns. Firstly, we obtained that the trend of extreme precipitation indices is more significant than the corresponding for accumulated precipitation. Moreover, we obtained stronger relationships between extreme precipitation indices and teleconnetion than the corresponding for accumulated precipitation. These differences are analysed by using composite maps. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is the teleconnection pattern that presents the highest influence on precipitation extremes over Europe in winter, particularly in southern and northern regions. With regard to other seasons, the Scandinavian teleconnection pattern (SCAND) plays an important role. We extend the study to regional climate model data (RCMs), provided by the European Union-funded ENSEMBLES project, to compare the trend of the simulated and observed extreme precipitation indices.<\/p>\n<p>Haylock, M.

Some of the most commonly used extreme indicators are based on percentiles. In this study we calculate  extreme percentiles in maximum (95p) and minimum (5p) temperature derived from dynamical and statistical downscaling methods over the Iberian Peninsula. We analyze some of the regional climate models (RCMs) provided by the ENSEMBLES (EU-funded) and esTcena (strategic action of Plan Nacional de I+D+i 2008-2011 funded by the Spanish government) projects.<\/p>\n<p>The downscaling methods are first tested in present climate using reanalysis data as large scale input in order to assess to what extent these approaches reproduce the observed percentiles. To this end, we consider the new, public, gridded dataset developed for continental Spain and Balearic Islands with 0.2º resolution (Spain02; Herrera et al. 2012). The comparison among the different models is obtained in terms of both the annual and seasonal biases. <\/p>\n<p> Secondly, we analyze the effect of nesting the methods to different GCMs, using the 20C3M historical scenario as reference. The study assesses the changes projected for extreme temperature percentiles in two future periods (near and far future) for the A1B emission scenario. By analyzing these changes, we are able to extract differences due to the downscaling method and to the driving Global Circulation Model (GCM).<\/p>\n<p>Herrera, S., Gutierrez, J., Ancell, R., Pons, M., Frias, M., and Fernandez, J.: Development and Analysis of a 50 year high-resolution daily gridded precipitation dataset over Spain (Spain02).

Moreover, these areas represent a variety of climate conditions. Over Spain, the Spain011\/044 data sets are considered, which exactly match the Euro-CORDEX grid over Spain. The Alpine data set has been derived from the EURO4M gridded precipitation product provided by MeteoSwiss at 5km resolution. Observations were spatially averaged to match the Euro-CORDEX grid cells. In order to make the SDM results comparable, they were calibrated using the gridded observations as predictand and model performance was evaluated in a cross-validation framework. Bias correction methods and an additional SD step are applied to the RCM data to also incorporate observational information. The ability of the high-resolution RCM simulations (0.11°) to represent observed precipitation is furthermore assessed at their skillful scale, by aggregating the 0.11° grid to the 0.44° resolution and evaluating the added value with respect to the low resolution (0.44°) runs.<\/p>"

CIIs are typically based on different weather variables such as temperature, wind speed, precipitation or humidity and comprise, in a single index, the relevant meteorological information for the particular impact sector (in this study wildfires and tourism). This dependence on several climate variables poses important limitations to the application of statistical downscaling techniques, since physical consistency among variables is required in most cases to obtain reliable local projections. The present study assesses the suitability of the “direct” downscaling approach, in which the downscaling method is directly applied to the CII. In particular, for illustrative purposes, we consider two popular indices used in the wildfire and tourism sectors, the Fire Weather Index (FWI) and the Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET), respectively. As an example, two case studies are analysed over two representative Mediterranean regions of interest for the EU CLIM-RUN project: continental Spain for the FWI and Croatia for the PET.<\/p>\n<p>Results obtained with this “direct” downscaling approach are similar to those found from the application of the statistical downscaling to the individual meteorological drivers prior to the index calculation (“component” downscaling) thus, a wider range of statistical downscaling methods could be used. As an illustration, future changes in both indices are projected by applying two direct statistical downscaling methods, analogs and linear regression, to the ECHAM5 model. Larger differences were found between the two direct statistical downscaling approaches than between the direct and the component approaches with a single downscaling method.<\/p>\n<p>While these examples focus on particular indices and Mediterranean regions of interest for CLIM-RUN stakeholders, the same study could be extended to other indices and regions.<\/p>"

However, the number of available experiments is strongly reduced when considering only computationally costly regional climate model (RCM) runs. These simulations are used as input for many impact studies, but usually after a statistical post-processing which takes into account the observations at station level (or very high resolution grids) and is commonly known as bias correction. These methods have been primarily developed for removing model biases, although they are also implicitly used to bridge the scale mismatch between model grids and local observations. <\/p>\n<p>Given that bias correction can be directly applied to Global Circulation Models (GCMs), we assess the role of RCMs as intermediaries between GCMs and bias correction methods. We apply different bias correction methods (from the simple scaling to different versions of the quantile-quantile mapping) directly to daily precipitation from a set of coarse resolution CMIP5 GCMs and compare them with bias-corrected EURO-CORDEX RCMs (namely COSMO-CLM and RCA at 12km horizontal resolution) for historical and future periods. We use a subset of European stations from the ECA&amp;D dataset as observational reference for the bias correction. Additionally, a refined analysis in the Ebro catchment illustrates the effect of bias correction on spatial climate variability. <\/p>\n<p>The evaluation experiment of the historical simulations in a cross-validation framework shows that bias corrected RCMs and GCMs typically present similar biases, but an added value of RCMs is found for the spatial analysis.

The present study analyzes two aspects that should be taken into account before using these methods in specific applications. First, we assess the added value of high resolution simulations from a EURO-CORDEX RCM ensemble. Secondly, RCMs are compared with SDMs, in order to show the merits and limitations of both downscaling techniques. Both aspects are assessed in terms of mean and extreme precipitation indices in Spain.<\/p>\n<p>The EURO-CORDEX initiative provides an appropriate framework for this study, since a common grid is used for all RCMs and the high and low resolution grids match each other at the grid cell boundaries. The ability of the high-resolution RCM simulations (0.11°) to represent observed precipitation is assessed at their skillful scale, by aggregating the 0.11° grid to the 0.44° resolution and evaluating the added value with respect to the low resolution (0.44°) runs. Since RCMs are prone to systematic biases, the added value of the high resolution runs is also analyzed after applying bias correction methods to the RCMs. Gridded observational products are available over the same grids as the RCMs, such as the Spain02 v4 family of EURO-CORDEX-compliant gridded datasets over Spain. Therefore, the evaluation of the RCMs and the development of the SDMs can be carried out on exactly the same grids, and SDMs produce a downscaling output comparable to the RCMs. A set of SDMs (namely analog resampling, weather typing and different versions of Generalized Linear Models) are applied using ERA-Interim predictor variables under a cross-validation approach.<\/p>\n<p>Results show limited evidence for an added value of the high resolution RCM simulations in terms of seasonal mean biases. There is an indication of added value in the spatial patterns; however, this is not statistically significant after bias correcting both simulations.<br \/>\nThe comparison of RCMs and SDMs based on specific precipitation-derived indices may not be fair as long as they are related to parameters that have been optimized in the calibration phase of SDMs. When the comparison is performed in terms of non-optimized parameters (e.g. dry spells), both downscaling techniques present similar skills and limitations.<\/p>"

Despite adjusting the desired features under historical simulations, their application in a climate change context is subject to additional uncertainties and modifications of the change signals, especially for climate indices which have not been tackled by the methods. In this sense, some of the commonly-used bias adjustment methods allow changes of the signals, which appear by construction in case of intensity-dependent biases; some others ensure the trends in some statistics of the original, raw models. Two relevant sources of uncertainty, often overlooked, which bring further uncertainties are the sensitivity to the observational reference used to calibrate the method and the effect of the resolution mismatch between model and observations (downscaling effect).<\/p>\n<p>In the present work, we assess the impact of these factors on the climate change signal of a set of climate indices of temperature and precipitation considering marginal, temporal and extreme aspects. We use eight standard and state-of-the-art bias adjustment methods (spanning a variety of methods regarding their nature -empirical or  parametric-, fitted parameters and preservation of the signals) for a case study in the Iberian Peninsula. The quantile trend-preserving methods (namely quantile delta mapping -QDM-, scaled distribution mapping -SDM- and the method from the third phase of ISIMIP -ISIMIP3) preserve better the raw signals for the different indices and<br \/>\nvariables (not all preserved by construction). However they rely largely on the reference dataset used for calibration, thus present a larger sensitivity to the observations, especially for precipitation intensity, spells and extreme indices. Thus, high-quality observational datasets are essential for comprehensive analyses in larger (continental) domains. Similar conclusions hold for experiments carried out at high (approximately 20km) and low (approximately 120km) spatial resolutions.<\/p>"

Due to the urban heat island (UHI) effect and its (generally) increased intensity particularly during nighttime, people living in urban areas happen to be more affected by heat-related discomfort and health risks than those in non-urban regions. In this contribution,  temperatures of both rural and urban sites (station couples) in Switzerland and Southern Germany are analyzed, using (i) observed as well as (ii) bias-corrected<br \/>\nand downscaled climate model data for daily minimum (tmin) and daily maximum temperature (tmax) to account for the UHI in future climates. As meteorological data are often restricted to locations of long-term measurements at rural sites only, they need to be transferred to urban sites first. For this purpose, the well-established quantile mapping technique (QM) is tested in a two- step manner. The resulting products are urban time series at daily resolution for tmin and tmax. By analyzing the temperature differences of the observed climate at rural sites and their respective urban counterparts and by assuming a stationary relationship between both, we can represent the UHI in future climates, which is quantified in terms of heat indices based on tmin and tmax (tropical nights, summer days, hot days).<br \/>\nThe QM performance is evaluated using long-term weather station data of a Zurich station couple in a comprehensive cross-validation framework. Results reveal a promising performance in the present-day climate, given very low biases in the validation.<br \/>\nApplying the proposed method to the employed station couples, projections indicate distinct urban-rural temperature differences (UHI) during nighttime (considering the frequency of tropical nights based on tmin) compared to weak differences during the day (considering the frequency of summer days and hot days based on tmax). Moreover, scenarios suggest the frequency of all indices to dramatically rise at the urban site by the end of the century under a strong emission scenario (RCP8.5): compared to the rural site, the number of tropical nights almost doubles while the number of summer days reveals about 15% more days at the urban site when focusing on the station couple in Zurich and the late scenario period. The lack of nighttime relief, indicated by tmin not falling below 20°C (i.e. a tropical night), is especially problematic in terms of human health andmakes the study of the urban climate in general and the UHI effect in particular indispensable.<\/p>"

This design makes TDS performance to scale badly and management difficulties arise when a huge catalog tree has to be maintained or when the TDS has to deal with overloads, causing a degraded or faulty service. Currently, the ESGF-node includes a gateway to the services running in the ESGF-node. One of these services is the TDS web application which runs in the ESGF-node sharing existing resources on the host. The ESGF-node design only considers one TDS instance running besides to the rest of ESGF-node services. Also, this TDS instance deploys the complete catalog hierarchy automatically generated by the esg-publisher, which can become difficult to maintain and to scale if lots of datasets and collections are generated. In this contribution, we show a way of deploying a load balanced and automatic provisioned cluster of TDS instances. The definition of the desired infrastructure is declared in a YAML file for Ansible (Infrastructure as Code, IaC), which uses roles and playbooks, that will automatically deploy the cluster of TDS instances and catalogs. This definition of the deployment infrastructure follows the TDS Deployment Model, which is composed by Collections, Replicas and Instances deployed in Hosts conforming Clusters. A Collection is a hierarchy of THREDDS file catalogs that can be deployed to a regular TDS instance on its own. TDS instances are Apache Tomcat server instances, accessed from the outside through a gateway (i.e. reverse proxy), running the TDS web application in a load balanced way. We refer to every publication of the collection in the TDS instances as a replica. Following this TDS Deployment Model, a sysadmin can define both instances and hosts where each replica will be deployed conforming a cluster. The TDS Deployment Model and its implementation have been tested with the current deployment of a ESGF-node in order to extend the data node to act as full functional gateway of a distributed cluster of TDS instances. We conclude that it is feasible to add automatically deployed load balancing support, catalog partitioning and integration with the current publication workflow to the architecture of the ESGF data node.<\/p>"

Due to the great increase in the size of the datasets and the need to provide computation environments close to data storage, data providers are evaluating the use of commercial clouds as an alternative for data storage. Examples of commercial clouds are Google Cloud Storage and Amazon S3, although cloud storage is not restricted to commercial clouds since several institutions provide private or hybrid clouds.

            "drupal_node_body" : "<p>Climate datasets are usually provided in separate files that facilitate dataset management in climate data distribution systems. In ESGF1 (Earth System Grid Federation) a time series of a variable is split into smaller pieces of data in order to reduce file size. Although this enhances usability for data management in the ESGF distribution system (i.e. file publishing, download, …), this demotes usability for data analysis. Usually, workflows need to pre-process and rearrange multiple files as a single data source, in order to obtain a data analysis dataset, involving data rewriting and duplication with the corresponding storage growth.<\/p>\n<p>The mitigation of storage growth can be achieved by creating virtual views, allowing a number of actual datasets to be multidimensionally mapped together into a single multidimensional dataset that does not require rewriting data nor to consume additional storage. Due to the increasing interest in offering to climate researchers appropriate single data analysis datasets, some mechanisms have been or are being developed to tackle this issue, such as NcML (netCDF Markup Language), xarray\/netCDF-4 Multiple File datasets and H5VDS. HDF5 Virtual Datasets3 (H5VDS) provide researchers with different views of interest of a compound dataset, without the cost of duplicating information, facilitating data analysis in an easy and transparent way.<\/p>\n<p>In the climate community and in ESGF, netCDF is the standard data model and format for climate data exchange. netCDF-4 default storage format is HDF5, introducing into the netCDF library features from HDF5. This includes chunking2, compression2, virtual datasets and many other capabilities. H5VDS introduces a new dataset storage type that allows a number of multiple HDF5 (and netCDF-4) datasets to be mapped together into a single sliceable dataset via an interface layer. The datasets can be mixed in arbitrary combinations, based on range selection mapping to range selection on sources. This mapping allows mapping between different data types and to add, remove or modify existing metadata (i.e. datasets attributes), which usually it’s a common issue to access the data. <\/p>\n<p>In this work, examples of applications of H5VDS features are applied to CMIP6 climate simulations datasets from ESGF, in order to provide data analysis ready virtual datasets. Examples of common tools\/libraries (i.e. netcdf-c, xarray, nco, cdo, …) illustrate the convenience of the proposed approach. Using H5VDS facilitates data analysis workflows by enabling climate researchers to focus on data analysis rather than data engineering tasks. Also, since the H5VDS is created at the storage layer, these datasets are transparent to the netCDF-4 library and existing applications can benefit from this feature.<\/p>"

Famously, Cowell (2001) showed that algorithms in the first two classes learn the same structures when the topological ordering of the network is known and we use entropy to assess conditional independence and goodness of fit. In this paper we address the complementary question: how do these classes of algorithms perform outside of the assumptions above? We approach this question by recognising that structure learning is defined by the combination of a statistical criterion and an algorithm that determines how the criterion is applied to the data. Removing the confounding effect of different choices for the statistical criterion, we find using both simulated and real-world data that constraint-based algorithms do not appear to be more efficient or more sensitive to errors than score-based algorithms; and that hybrid algorithms are not faster or more accurate than constraint-based algorithms. This suggests that commonly held beliefs on structure learning in the literature are strongly influenced by the choice of particular statistical criteria rather than just properties of the algorithms themselves.<\/p>"

Convection parametrizations have a strong influence on precipitation uncertainty in coarser climate simulations, also increasing inter-model variability. Therefore, CP-RCMs are expected to better represent precipitation climatology, with special emphasis on extreme events related to convective processes. For the first time, a multi-model ensemble of such high-resolution RCMs over the Mediterranean is being produced within the framework of the international CORDEX - Flagship Pilot Study on Convective phenomena at high resolution over Europe and the Mediterranean (FPS-CEM).<br \/>\nAs model resolution increases, accuracy and resolution of input information, such as land use and soil texture, become more important. Quality of these data may have a strong impact not only on surface fluxes, but also on the representation of boundary layer evolution and precipitation, which depends on the strength of the land-atmosphere coupling.<br \/>\nIn this work, we used the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, where this static information is, by default, based on MODIS land use and FAO soil texture. We adapted higher resolution and up-to-date data sets for WRF, based on CORINE (at 100 m resolution) for land use and on HWSD and BÜK databases (at 1 km resolution) for top soil texture data. These new static data have been used by all WRF groups involved in the FPS-CEM.<br \/>\nWe extended the case-study experimental design of the FPS-CEM (Coppola et al. 2018) to include the WRF sensitivity to these available static data. For this experiment, we generated two 8-member ensembles, one for a summer and one for a winter case. The two cases resemble the two test cases (Austria and Foehn case) conducted in climate mode (~1 month long). For each case, 4 simulations differing in combinations of the static data have been conducted twice, with different physical parameterization settings.<br \/>\nIn this study we focus on representation of land-surface-atmosphere (LA) feedback processes over the Alpine domain on CP scale, and its sensitivity to (1) land-surface static forcing, (2) season, and (3) WRF configuration.  To quantify the strength of LA coupling for each grid, we use coupling metrics appropriate for relatively short time scales, such as mixing diagram.

It is important, though, to keep in mind that the quality of each of such high resolution simulations strongly depend on the quality of the forcing used to drive the model.<br \/>\nIn this work we investigate the impact of the land-surface forcing on the model representation of land-atmosphere (LA) feedback. For that we used the 2 Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) settings from the CORDEX-FPS-CEM ensemble to run 4 simulations for 2 seasons (summer and fall), combining 2 sets of data for the land cover (MODIS and CORINE) and the top soil texture (FAO and HWSD). In such a way we generated two ensembles with 8 simulations for each season. Additionally we run 4 simulations with perturbed starting date for the summer season to obtain an additional 5-member ensemble to investigate the impact of the internal variability on the final results.<br \/>\nThe objective of this study is to investigate the model sensitivity to (1) land-surface static forcing, (2) season, and (3) the model configuration. To quantify the strength of LA coupling for each grid, we use coupling metrics appropriate for seasonal time scales. We applied mixing diagram approach to investigate the impact of the land-surface changes on the boundary layer evolution. We also investigate the impact of these changes on the potential for convection triggering, and we calculate correlation matrices to quantify the impact on the strength of the land-atmosphere coupling.<br \/>\nPreliminary results show evident effects of the land surface changes on surface variables, boundary layer evolution, atmospheric stability and humidity in the lower atmosphere. Strength of the sensitivity to a specific change in the land-surface forcing depend on the model configuration: WRF with less sophisticated parameterization schemes is more sensitive to land use changes, while more sophisticated configuration shows higher sensitivity to the soil texture changes in representing boundary layer evolution. Furthermore, the WRF shows stronger coupling and therefore stronger sensitivity to the land surface changes in the summer season.<\/p>\n<p>Acknowledgement: This work is supported by the Spanish Government  through  the project \"Apoyo a unidades de excelencia María de Maeztu\" (MdM-2017-0765), and R+D programme through grant INSIGNIA (CGL2016-79210-R) co-funded by the ERDF\/FEDER.

and socio-economic issue. The last few decades though, the number of forest fires has significantly increased, as&lt;br />
well as their severity and impact on the environment. Local fire danger projections are often required when dealing&lt;br />
with wild fire research. In the present study the application of statistical downscaling and spatial interpolation&lt;br />
methods was performed to the Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI), in order to assess forest fire risk in Greece.&lt;br />
The FWI is used worldwide (including the Mediterranean basin) to estimate the fire danger in a generalized fuel&lt;br />
type, based solely on weather observations. The meteorological inputs to the FWI System are noon values of&lt;br />
dry-bulb temperature, air relative humidity, 10m wind speed and precipitation during the previous 24 hours.&lt;br />
The statistical downscaling methods are based on a statistical model that takes into account empirical relationships&lt;br />
between large scale variables (used as predictors) and local scale variables. In the framework&lt;br />
of the current study the statistical downscaling portal developed by the Santander Meteorology Group&lt;br />
(&lt;a href="https://www.meteo.unican.es/downscaling" title="https://www.meteo.unican.es/downscaling">https://www.meteo.unican.es/downscaling&lt;/a>) in the framework of the EU project CLIMRUN (&lt;a href="http://www.climrun.eu" title="www.climrun.eu">www.climrun.eu&lt;/a>)&lt;br />
was used to downscale non standard parameters related to forest fire risk.&lt;br />
In this study, two different approaches were adopted. Firstly, the analogue downscaling technique was directly&lt;br />
performed to the FWI index values and secondly the same downscaling technique was performed indirectly through&lt;br />
the meteorological inputs of the index. In both cases, the statistical downscaling portal was used considering the&lt;br />
ERA-Interim reanalysis as predictands due to the lack of observations at noon.&lt;br />
Additionally, a three-dimensional (3D) interpolation method of position and elevation, based on Thin Plate Splines&lt;br />
(TPS) was used, to interpolate the ERA-Interim data used to calculate the index. Results from this method were&lt;br />
compared with the statistical downscaling results obtained from the portal.&lt;br />
Finally, FWI was computed using weather observations obtained from the Hellenic National Meteorological Service,&lt;br />
mainly in the south continental part of Greece and a comparison with the previous results was performed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Assessing the predictability of fire occurrence and area burned across phytoclimatic regions in Spain</title><link>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/assessing-the-predictability-of-fire/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:33:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://santandermetgroup.github.io/website-demo/event/assessing-the-predictability-of-fire/</guid><description>&lt;p>We address the predictability of daily fire occurrence using the components of the Canadian Fire Weather Index System (FWI) and related variables calculated from the ERA-Interim reanalysis.&lt;br />
We develop models in peninsular Spain for the period 1990-2008 for daily fire occurrence (GLMs) and monthly burned area (MARS), and for different phytoclimatic regions.&lt;br />
We assess occurrence model performance using ROC skill area (RSA) and testing their ability to reproduce inter-annual fire-frequency variability, considering different burned area thresholds.&lt;br />
The sensitivity of the models to the level of spatial aggregation of the data is also evaluated. Additionally, we investigate the gain in model performance with the inclusion of socio-economic and land use/land cover (LULC) covariates in model formulation.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

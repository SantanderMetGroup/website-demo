<p>Forest fires have always been present in the Mediterranean ecosystems, thus they constitute a major ecological<br />
and socio-economic issue. The last few decades though, the number of forest fires has significantly increased, as<br />
well as their severity and impact on the environment. Local fire danger projections are often required when dealing<br />
with wild fire research. In the present study the application of statistical downscaling and spatial interpolation<br />
methods was performed to the Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI), in order to assess forest fire risk in Greece.<br />
The FWI is used worldwide (including the Mediterranean basin) to estimate the fire danger in a generalized fuel<br />
type, based solely on weather observations. The meteorological inputs to the FWI System are noon values of<br />
dry-bulb temperature, air relative humidity, 10m wind speed and precipitation during the previous 24 hours.<br />
The statistical downscaling methods are based on a statistical model that takes into account empirical relationships<br />
between large scale variables (used as predictors) and local scale variables. In the framework<br />
of the current study the statistical downscaling portal developed by the Santander Meteorology Group<br />
(<a href="https://www.meteo.unican.es/downscaling" title="https://www.meteo.unican.es/downscaling">https://www.meteo.unican.es/downscaling</a>) in the framework of the EU project CLIMRUN (<a href="http://www.climrun.eu" title="www.climrun.eu">www.climrun.eu</a>)<br />
was used to downscale non standard parameters related to forest fire risk.<br />
In this study, two different approaches were adopted. Firstly, the analogue downscaling technique was directly<br />
performed to the FWI index values and secondly the same downscaling technique was performed indirectly through<br />
the meteorological inputs of the index. In both cases, the statistical downscaling portal was used considering the<br />
ERA-Interim reanalysis as predictands due to the lack of observations at noon.<br />
Additionally, a three-dimensional (3D) interpolation method of position and elevation, based on Thin Plate Splines<br />
(TPS) was used, to interpolate the ERA-Interim data used to calculate the index. Results from this method were<br />
compared with the statistical downscaling results obtained from the portal.<br />
Finally, FWI was computed using weather observations obtained from the Hellenic National Meteorological Service,<br />
mainly in the south continental part of Greece and a comparison with the previous results was performed.</p>

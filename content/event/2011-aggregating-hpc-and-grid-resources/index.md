The emergence of Grid initiatives to create seamless access to geographically distributed heterogeneous resources has not reached all computing infrastructures. In particular, systems with high capacity computing power like HPC are not commonly accessible through any Grid middleware. This paper tries to establish the requirements for providing researchers with a tool that allow them to access Grid and non-Grid computing resources in a seamlessly manner. In order to make a proof of concept, a prototype based on the GridWay metascheduler is presented.

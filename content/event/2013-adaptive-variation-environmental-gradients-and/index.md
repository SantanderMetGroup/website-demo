<p>Current and future species responses to predicted environmental changes are embedded in demographic and evolutionary processes that occurred in the past. Therefore, understanding range-wide patterns and interactions between environmental change, demography and evolution taking place in the past is essential for developing future management strategies.</p>
<p>Maritime pine, an ecologically and economically important tree species, lives in a highly heterogeneous environment, and is hence of great interest to assess its adaptive potential to foreseen changes in the Mediterranean forests, i.e. increase in aridity and recent land-use change. </p>
<p>Combining various complementary approaches and looking at three distinct level of variation (gene, phenotype, and nice) we investigate adaptive patterns in this conifer at its distribution scale.</p>

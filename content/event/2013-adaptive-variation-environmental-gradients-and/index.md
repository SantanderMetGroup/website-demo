Current and future species responses to predicted environmental changes are embedded in demographic and evolutionary processes that occurred in the past. Therefore, understanding range-wide patterns and interactions between environmental change, demography and evolution taking place in the past is essential for developing future management strategies.

Maritime pine, an ecologically and economically important tree species, lives in a highly heterogeneous environment, and is hence of great interest to assess its adaptive potential to foreseen changes in the Mediterranean forests, i.e. increase in aridity and recent land-use change. 

Combining various complementary approaches and looking at three distinct level of variation (gene, phenotype, and nice) we investigate adaptive patterns in this conifer at its distribution scale.

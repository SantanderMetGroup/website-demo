<p>ESCENA (<a href="http://proyectoescena.uclm.es" title="http://proyectoescena.uclm.es">http://proyectoescena.uclm.es</a>) was part of the Spanish Strategic action on energy and<br />
climate change. Funded by the Spanish government, this call aimed at providing the scientific basis<br />
for the assessment of regional climate change impacts over Spain (including continental Spain, the<br />
Balearic and Canary islands). The ESCENA project (2008-2011) agglutinated the regional climate<br />
modelling efforts. Four different institutions contributed simulations using 4 different Regional Climate<br />
Models (RCMs): Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha (UCLM, PROMES model), Universidad de<br />
Murcia (UMUR, MM5 model), Universidad de Alcalá de Henares (UAHE, REMO model) and<br />
Universidad de Cantabria (UCAN, WRF model).<br />
The boundary forcing came from the Global Climate Model (GCM) simulations generated by the third<br />
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) for the 4th IPCC Assessment Report (AR4). We<br />
used three different GCMs (ECHAM5-MPIOM, CNRM-CM3 and HadCM3) forced by the A1B, A2, and<br />
B1 emissions scenarios. An interesting feature of the experimental setup in ESCENA was the<br />
GCM/RCM matrix, which was designed to enable the comparison of different RCMs projections with a<br />
single specific change (RCM, scenario, GCM, parameterization). This allows the exploration of the<br />
role of different sources of uncertainty. The RCM simulations cover a common minimum domain<br />
encompassing the whole Spanish territory with a horizontal resolution of 25 Km.<br />
The project focused on the near future, simulating a control period (1950-2000, 1950 left as spin-up<br />
and disregarded in the analyses) forced by the 20C3M historical scenario and continued by a 50-year<br />
period, 2001-2050, of future projection. In this work we present the main results of the project,<br />
focusing on the future climate projection scenarios for impact-relevant variables.</p>

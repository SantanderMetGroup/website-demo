<p>A global frame for the determination of shallow water wave energy resources is developed. The methodology steps are: a) calibration of a wave reanalysis data base; b) classification of the sea states by means of the Self-Organizing Maps technique to obtain the number of sea states representatives of the wave climate in deep waters; c) propagation of the selected sea states using any state-ofthe-art wave propagation model and propagation of the whole reanalysis data base using an interpolation scheme; d) application of different statistical models to define energy resources.</p>

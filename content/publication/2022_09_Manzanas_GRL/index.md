  The Jenkinson-Collison weather typing scheme (JC-WT) is an automated method
  used to classify the regional atmospheric circulation into a reduced number of
  typical recurrent patterns, identified in the early 1970ies on the basis of
  expert knowledge. Originally developed for the British Isles, the method since
  then has seen many applications. Encouraged by the estimate that the JC-WT
  approach can in principle be applied to any mid-to-high latitude region(Jones
  et al, 2013), the present study explores whether it can be used anywhere in the
  extratropics, including the Southern Hemisphere. To this aim, JC-WT is applied
  at each grid-box of a global 2.5° regular grid excluding the inner tropics ( ±
  5° band) where the method cannot be applied. Thereby, 6-hourly JC-WT catalogues
  are obtained for 5 distinct reanalyses, covering the period 1979-2005, which
  are then applied to explore 1) the method's limits of applicability and 2)
  observational uncertainties inherent to reanalysis datasets. Using evaluation
  criteria such as the diversity of occurring circulation types and the frequency
  of unclassified situations, we extract empirically derived applicability
  thresholds which suggest that JC-WT can be generally used anywhere polewards of
  22.5°. Seasonal variations compromise this finding along the equatorward limits
  of the domain, and so does the effect of large orographic barriers such as the
  Tibetan Plateau, the Andes, Greenland and Antarctica. In some regions, the
  JC-WT classifications obtained from the distinct reanalyses substantially
  differ from each other and this should be taken into account by further
  applications of the method.

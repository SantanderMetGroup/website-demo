title: 'CORDyS | Contribution to the next generation of CORDEX regional climate projections: Dynamical and Statistical approaches'
summary: >
  CORDEX is currently facing the downscaling of CMIP6 global climate models
  (GCMs), which represent the latest generation of Coupled Earth System Models.
  This proposal (CORDyS) aims to contribute to this next generation of CORDEX
  regional climate projections using both dynamical and statistical downscaling
  methods, including statistical emulators of the dynamical models. Our objective
  is to contribute to (1) the process-based evaluation of the driving GCMs, (2)
  the downscaling of future climate projections for the current standard
  continental-scale CORDEX EUR-11 domain, (3) the further downscaling of future
  projections at very high resolution using a convection-permitting RCM and
  statistical emulators, (4) the distillation of actionable regional climate
  information for impacts assessment from these new-generation sources, and (5)
  the dissemination and publication of results and data products in the CORDEX
  community and ESGF infrastructure.
